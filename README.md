## Contributing Content

We recommend forking the repo, creating all content changes in branches, and submitting pull requests. We will work with you to get this content reviewed, tested, and merged for publishing.

## Building Locally

Docusaurus requires the following to build on locals:

* [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) version recommended: 16.14.0)
* Verify the Node.js version by opening Command Prompt/Terminal and running node -v
* Download Git [here](https://git-scm.com/downloads)
* [VS Code Editor](https://code.visualstudio.com/download)

To build on your local:

1. Clone the repo using Git or tools like GitHub Desktop.
2. In a terminal, change to the cloned repo folder. Run the install command: `npm install`.
3. To serve and review your content, use one of the following:
   * Use start, hot reloads as you make changes: `npm start`. 
4. To build locally and test your links, run `npm run build`. Any issues with broken links and images are listed according to file. Locate and update those issues, then run `npm serve` and start again to verify.

Note- If the command doesn't work, try `npm i react-scripts@latest` followed by `npm start`.

The static files are generated in the build folder and run on your local machine at: http://localhost:3000/. To stop the build or served site, hit Ctrl + C to interrupt. You can enter new commands in terminal, rebuild, and restart.

## Publishing Content

As pull requests are merged to the `main` branch by the [LambdaTest Documentation](https://lambdatest.com/support/docs/) team, the content builds and deploys to a staging site. This allows you to review and test your content thoroughly on a server, rather than a local build, prior to merging your code to production.
