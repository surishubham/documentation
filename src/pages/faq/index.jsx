              <summary>Would I need to install a software or extension to use LambdaTest virtual machines?
              </summary>
              <p>No. You don't need to install any software or extension or plugin or setting configurations of any type. Just need to login to LambdaTest, open the virtual machine through launcher, and start testing. That's the beauty of cloud. It gets you started super quick.</p>

              <summary>It is showing 'Session Limit reached' error even though I am not running a session.
              </summary>
              <p>The number of sessions is limited by number of sessions running by a organization, not by user. Therefore it is entirely possible that you reach out of session limit even if only one or two users are using LambdaTest tool. Co-ordinate with your teammates in this case. If you are sure there is session issue from our end, you can raise a ticket at our support portal. Don't worry, we have a very fast turnaround time.</p>

              <summary>What happens when I leave the session idle?
              </summary>
              <p>By default, if you leave the Lamdatest Live session idle for 5 minutes, the app will prompt a reminder. If no action is taken then LambdaTest would close the live session. You can change this setting from Live settings options. Checkout this link to understand more about it.</p>

            <details>
              <summary>What happens when I switch to another tab in my browser?
              </summary>
              <p>Switching tab won't stop or pause the Live session. If left idle for 5 minutes or more, LambdaTest will prompt a reminder and if unanswered will close the session.</p>
            </details>
            <details>
              <summary>When you give the machine to somebody else would they be able to access my history and saved passwords?
              </summary>
              <p>The moment you close the session, LambdaTest automatically sanitize the whole virtual machine. What that means is that we delete all historical data, downloads, installed extensions, saved passwords, etc. We reset the browsers to factory settings. This automatically logs you out of all pages and auto deletes all data that you may have saved. You would still have access to screenshots and issues you may have generated during the session.</p>

              <summary>Would i have to reset and re-configure browser settings every time I create a new session?
              </summary>
              <p>Yes! Every time you close a session we would reset all settings. We are working on a way to help you change and save a set of customized default browser settings. If your need is critical and changing browser settings in each new session takes a lot of your time, send us a message from here. We will try to find a solution for you.</p>

              </summary>
              <p>It's simple. In real time browser, on left side you will find multiple action buttons in the controller. One of them will be a screenshot button with camera icon. Just click that and in no time your screenshot will be recorded. Once recorded, an image editor will pop up where you can edit the screenshot, mark it as a bug and comment about the details. Lastly, you can find them anytime in test logs section of the menu.</p>

              <summary>What is WebDriverIO
              </summary>
              <p>WebdriverIO is a browser and automation test framework based in Node.js. Adding helper functions in WebDriverIO is really simple in WebDriverIO. Also, it can run both on WebDriver protocol and Chrome Devtools protocol, making it efficient for both Selenium Webdriver based cross browser testing or Chromium based automation. To top it off, since WebDriverIO is open source, you get a bunch of plugins for your automation needs.</p>

              <summary>Can I Mark My Test As Pass Or Fail?
              </summary>
              <p>The LambdaTest Selenium grid doesn’t identify if you test ‘passed’ or ‘failed’. It only identifies whether a test has executed to it’s last command or whether it has stopped/timed-out before it. The user would have to pass on these parameters to LambdaTest platform to make it possible for tracking these values at LambdaTest platform. Make use of LambdaTest API or LambdaTest Annotations, for pushing additional metadata to LambdaTest or to track the pass/fail status of a test.</p>

              <summary>Can I Run Parallel Testing using JUnit Framework?
              </summary>
              <p>Yes! One of the key features of LambdaTest Selenium grid is the ability to run your test cases in parallel. Which means you can execute numerous automation test cases altogether and enable you to cut down on test times. With LambdaTest Selenium grid you can run a single test scenario across different browsers or different test scenarios with the same browser (or any other combinations). Wondering how many parallel test cases can you run? That depends entirely on the number of concurrent sessions under your opted plan.</p>

              <summary>What Is The Maximum Queuing Capacity?
              </summary>
              <p>Maximum number of test cases that can be queued = n + 150 Here, n = number of concurrent sessions. For instance, if you are opting for pricing where you can avail up to 10 concurrent sessions. Then the maximum number of test cases that can be queued will be equal to 10 + 150 i.e. 160 queued test cases. LambdaTest would automatically schedule and execute test cases for you.

                We have added a capacity constraint on the number of tests that can be queued to prevent over-exploitation of the platform. Refer LambdaTest Queuing Policy to know more.</p>

                  <p>HyperExecute provides you with smart CI features where you can run any command before and after running tests using pre and post steps. Common use cases include, building/ compiling binaries, downloading dependencies, starting services in the background or any other arbitrary command.</p>

                  </summary>
                  <p>HyperExecute takes your test scripts and places them in virtual machines having all the components required to run your tests and collect logs and metrics. These virtual machines are hosted by HyperExecute in its secure cloud environment. HyperExecute is also available on dedicated and private clouds where virtual machines can run in your personal cloud accounts.</p>

                  <summary>How to use HyperExecute?
                  </summary>
                  <p>Tests are triggered on HyperExecute using HyperExecute CLI using a YAML file to configure the executing settings including target OS, concurrency and other CI level information. This YAML file can be generated easily using a web based YAML generator that supports multiple languages and frameworks. As a user you need to focus on writing tests and running the CLI with YAML, everything else is taken care of by the orchestration platform.</p>

                  <summary>Why is HyperExecute faster than other end to end testing platforms?
                  </summary>
                  <p>Traditional end to end testing platforms add a lot of latency in test execution due to the fragmented components by adding multiple hops. Each and every request has to travel through multiple hops before it can be served by the application under test. This doesn’t just slow tests down, but adds a lot of platform-induced flakiness. HyperExecute puts all the components and the test script in a single isolated environment to run the tests in the fastest and the most efficient way.</p>

                  <summary>How does HyperExecute help me debug my tests faster?
                  </summary>
                  <p>HyperExecute collects every possible log, including terminal logs, selenium and more (for every single test), and stores them separately from each other. These isolated logs ensure that the end user is not spending time in filtering useful logs and focuses on getting the insights from the logs as fast as possible. HyperExecute also streams these test logs in real time to drastically reduce time wasted in debugging failed tests.</p>

              </summary>
              <p>In order to handle the location pop-up, you can use below capability in the script and the location will be auto handle in the test.<br />

                <code>caps.setCapability("autoAcceptAlerts", true);</code> <br /><br />

                Please note that <code>autoAcceptAlerts: true</code> won't work on iOS devices with iOS 14. This is a <a href="https://github.com/appium/appium/issues/14741">known issue</a> and already raised on Appium.<br /><br />

                <b>Note</b>: For iOS 13 and above, pop-ups can have more than two buttons. When there are more than two buttons on popups, autoDismissAlerts and autoAcceptAlerts behavior is flipped. For such popups, use autoAcceptAlerts to automatically dismiss all popups and autoDismissAlerts to automatically accept all popups.

              <summary>Briefly describe your security policies.</summary>
              <p>LambdaTest is a firm believer in secure experience and multifaceted security protocols, to ensure that every aspect including architecture, engineering, testing, and deployment, follows and complies with industry leading standards of security. As first line of defense, LambdaTest application is protected by AWS&#8217;s firewalls which are tasked with countering regular DDoS attacks and malicious network intrusions. The next line of defense is LambdaTest&#8217;s own application firewall protocols which are tasked with protecting the application against spam, ill-intent users, and malicious IP. We have also implemented secure user access policies for accessing LambdaTest platform and only users with valid user credentials can access the application. We have also implemented role based access to the application, each role having different access levels.</p>
              <p>Whenever a user initiates a test at LambdaTest platform, they are allotted a thoroughly sanitized virtual machine. And as soon as a session ends, all data including cookies, registry, caches, and running processes are deleted and all browser settings are reset to default values. Each virtual machine has to pass a series of automated tests before it is used again. Any machine that fails a test gets redacted from the pool for auditing and manual cleaning. At the time of test only the user has access to machine and not even LambdaTest has access to the user&#8217;s running test session. All machines have strict security protocols that prohibit any user from installing any external software in the machines.</p>
              <p>In our application we have implemented HTTPS by default, and use VNC protocols for secure data transfer. This data is also encrypted to ensure that data is not compromised in-transit.</p>
              <p>All our hosting centers are chosen based on their record of established security policies and excellent history. Our selection process is rigorous and we partner with only the best providers across globe that have been certified by major compliance regulators.</p>
              <p>All data saved in our application like login credentials, secure access keys, usage logs, test history, and billing details, are stored in an encrypted format.</p>
              <p>We have implemented strict 24&#215;7 security protections at our on-premise development centers. Only authorized individuals have access to building and LambdaTest office premises. Our application data is hosted on industry leading hosts like Amazon Web Services, who have been thoroughly tested by multiple third party auditors for security.

              <summary>Do you have a disaster recovery (DR) or Business Continuity Plan (BCP) plan? How often is it tested?</summary>
              <p>LambdaTest has a formal Business Continuity Plan (BCP) and Disaster Recovery Plan (DRP) defined and implemented to enable people, process, and technology support during any crisis or business interruptions. The BC and DR Plan is tested and reviewed on a yearly basis.

                And, Disaster Recovery (DR) program ensures that our Services remain available and are easily recoverable in the case of a disaster. This is accomplished through building a robust technical environment and creating Disaster Recovery plans and testing activities. In the event of a disaster, the following objectives apply:</p>

              <ol>
                <li><b>4-hour Recovery Time Objective (RTO)</b>: LambdaTest will aim to restore normal operations for your LambdaTest platform account within four hours from the time a disaster is declared, unless a disaster, or multiple disasters, impacts all of the Availability Zones used on an account.</li>

                <li> <b>Under 1-hour Recovery Point Objective (RPO)</b>: LambdaTest will target one hour or less of data loss for your account. This is calculated from the point of the disruption, not from LambdaTest’s disaster declaration.</li><br />

                <p>Also, LambdaTest employs service clustering and network redundancies to eliminate single points of failure. Our strict backup regime and/or our Disaster Recovery service offering allows us to deliver a high service availability, as customer or test data is replicated across availability zones.

                  <br /> <br />For more details, please refer to <a href="https://www.lambdatest.com/trust/security#business-continuity-and-disaster-recovery">LambdaTest Trust</a> page.</p>
