# Tutorial to run your first test on LambdaTest

---

In this topic, you will learn how to configure and run your Java automation testing scripts on [LambdaTest Selenium cloud platform](https://www.lambdatest.com/selenium-automation).

## Objective

---

By the end of this topic, you will be able to:

1. Set up an environment for testing your hosted web pages using **Java** with Selenium.
2. Specify which browsers to perform **Java** automation testing on.
3. Test your locally hosted pages on LambdaTest platform.
4. Explore advanced features of LambdaTest.

## Pre-requisites

---

Before you can start performing Java automation testing with Selenium, you would need to:

- Install the latest **Java development environment**. We recommend to use **Java 11** version.

- Download the latest **Selenium Client** and its **WebDriver bindings** from [the official website](https://www.selenium.dev/downloads/). Latest versions of **Selenium Client** and **WebDriver** are ideal for running your automation script on LambdaTest Selenium cloud grid.

- Setup your environment with required Selenium bindings if you are using an IDE for running the tests. These are the steps required to configure your IDE :

  - **Step 1:** Download the latest Java Selenium Bindings from the [official website](https://www.selenium.dev/downloads/) and extract the **ZIP** file to your project directory.
  - **Step 2:** Create a new Java project and once it's created, you can open the project settings. Here we are showing an example for the same in **IntelliJ IDEA CE**.
    <img loading="lazy" src={require('../assets/images/selenium/java1.png').default} alt="cmd" width="1260" height="1071" className="doc_img"/>

  - **Step 3:** Navigate to **dependencies** in module settings where you can add your external JARs.
  - **Step 4:** Under dependencies by clicking the **`+`** icon, you can add your downloaded **Selenium JARs** to the project. Once they are added, it should look like this :
    <img loading="lazy" src={require('../assets/images/selenium/java2.png').default} alt="cmd" width="1150" height="740" className="doc_img"/>

Now you are good to run the Java automation testing scripts.

## Run Your First Test

---

Letâ€™s start with a simple Selenium Remote WebDriver test first. The Java script below tests a simple to-do application with basic functionalities like mark items as done, add items in a list, calculate total pending items etc.

### Sample Test with Java

```java title="JavaToDo.java"
import java.net.MalformedURLException;
import java.net.URL;
import org.openqa.selenium.By;
import org.openqa.selenium.JavascriptExecutor;
import org.openqa.selenium.remote.DesiredCapabilities;
import org.openqa.selenium.remote.RemoteWebDriver;
public class JavaTodo {
    String username = "YOUR_LAMBDATEST_USERNAME";
    String accesskey = "YOUR_LAMBDATEST_ACCESS_KEY";
    static RemoteWebDriver driver = null;
    String gridURL = "@hub.lambdatest.com/wd/hub";
    boolean status = false;
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        new JavaTodo().test();
    }
    public void test() {
        // To Setup driver
        setUp();
        try {
              //Change it to production page
            driver.get("https://lambdatest.github.io/sample-todo-app/");

              //Let's mark done first two items in the list.
              driver.findElement(By.name("li1")).click();
            driver.findElement(By.name("li2")).click();

             // Let's add an item in the list.
              driver.findElement(By.id("sampletodotext")).sendKeys("Yey, Let's add it to list");
            driver.findElement(By.id("addbutton")).click();

              // Let's check that the item we added is added in the list.
            String enteredText = driver.findElementByXPath("/html/body/div/div/div/ul/li[6]/span").getText();
            if (enteredText.equals("Yey, Let's add it to list")) {
                status = true;
            }
        } catch (Exception e) {
            System.out.println(e.getMessage());
        } finally {
            tearDown();
        }
    }
    private void setUp() {
        DesiredCapabilities capabilities = new DesiredCapabilities();
        capabilities.setCapability("browserName", "chrome");
        capabilities.setCapability("version", "70.0");
        capabilities.setCapability("platform", "win10"); // If this cap isn't specified, it will just get any available one.
        capabilities.setCapability("build", "LambdaTestSampleApp");
        capabilities.setCapability("name", "LambdaTestJavaSample");
        try {
            driver = new RemoteWebDriver(new URL("https://" + username + ":" + accesskey + gridURL), capabilities);
        } catch (MalformedURLException e) {
            System.out.println("Invalid grid URL");
        } catch (Exception e) {
            System.out.println(e.getMessage());
        }
    }
    private void tearDown() {
        if (driver != null) {
            ((JavascriptExecutor) driver).executeScript("lambda-status=" + status);
            driver.quit(); //really important statement for preventing your test execution from a timeout.
        }
    }
}
```

**Step 1:** Once you setup your environment with the latest Java Selenium bindings, create a new java file `<file_name>.java` in your current project or testing directory and add the above code snippet.

### Setting up your Authentication

Make sure you have your LambdaTest credentials with you to run test automation scripts on LambdaTest Selenium Grid. You can obtain these credentials from the [LambdaTest Automation Dashboard](https://automation.lambdatest.com/build) or through [LambdaTest Profile](https://accounts.lambdatest.com/login).

**Step 2:** Please edit and add your **UserName** and **AccessKey** which are generated from the platform in your `<file_name>.java` file:

<div className="lambdatest__codeblock">
    <CodeBlock className="language-java">
  {`String username= "${ YOUR_LAMBDATEST_USERNAME()}"; 
String accesskey= "${ YOUR_LAMBDATEST_ACCESS_KEY()}";`}
  </CodeBlock>
</div>

### Configuring your Test Capabilities

**Step 3:** In this code, we are passing browser, browser version, and operating system information, along with LambdaTest Selenium grid capabilities via capabilities object. The capabilities object in the above code is defined as:

```java
DesiredCapabilities capabilities = new DesiredCapabilities();
        capabilities.setCapability("browserName", "chrome");
        capabilities.setCapability("version", "70.0");
        capabilities.setCapability("platform", "win10"); // If this cap isn't specified, it will just get the any available one
        capabilities.setCapability("build", "LambdaTestSampleApp");
        capabilities.setCapability("name", "LambdaTestJavaSample");
```

:::info Note

You can generate capabilities for your test requirements with the help of our inbuilt :link: **[Capabilities Generator tool](https://www.lambdatest.com/capabilities-generator/)**.

:::

### Executing the Test

- If you are using an editor or IDE for running your tests, you can just build and run your configured java file in your editor/IDE.
- If you are using a terminal/cmd, you would need to execute the following commands :

```bash
cd to/file/location
#Compile the test file:
javac -classpath ".:/path/to/selenium/jarfile:" <file_name>.java
#Run the test:
java -classpath ".:/path/to/selenium/jarfile:" <file_name>
```

**Example:**

```bash
cd /Users/macuser/Documents/LambdaTest_Java
javac -classpath ".:/Users/macuser/Documents/LambdaTest_Java/selenium-server-4.1.1.jar:" JavaTodo.java
java -classpath ".:/Users/macuser/Documents/LambdaTest_Java/selenium-server-4.1.1.jar:" JavaTodo
```

:::info

Your test results would be displayed on the test console (or command-line interface if you are using terminal/cmd) and on [LambdaTest automation dashboard](https://automation.lambdatest.com/build). LambdaTest Automation Dashboard will help you view all your text logs, screenshots and video recording for your entire automation tests.

## Testing Locally Hosted or Privately Hosted Projects

---

You can test your locally hosted or privately hosted projects with [LambdaTest Selenium grid cloud](https://www.lambdatest.com/selenium-automation) using LambdaTest Tunnel app. All you would have to do is set up an SSH tunnel using LambdaTest Tunnel app and pass toggle `tunnel = True` via desired capabilities. LambdaTest Tunnel establishes a secure SSH protocol based tunnel that allows you in testing your locally hosted or privately hosted pages, even before they are made live.

:::tip Tunnel Help

Refer our :link: [LambdaTest Tunnel documentation](https://www.lambdatest.com/support/docs/testing-locally-hosted-pages/) for more information.

:::

Hereâ€™s how you can establish LambdaTest Tunnel.

:::info Download the binary file

- [LambdaTest Tunnel for Windows](https://downloads.lambdatest.com/tunnel/v3/windows/64bit/LT_Windows.zip)
- [LambdaTest Tunnel for Mac](https://downloads.lambdatest.com/tunnel/v3/mac/64bit/LT_Mac.zip)
- [LambdaTest Tunnel for Linux](https://downloads.lambdatest.com/tunnel/v3/linux/64bit/LT_Linux.zip)

:::

Open command prompt and navigate to the binary folder.

Run the following command:

```bash
./LT -user {userâ€™s login email} -key {userâ€™s access key}
```

So if your user name is **lambdatest@example.com**, the command would be:

<div className="lambdatest__codeblock">
    <CodeBlock className="language-bash">
  {`./LT -user lambdatest@example.com -key ${ YOUR_LAMBDATEST_ACCESS_KEY()}`}
  </CodeBlock>
</div>

Once you are able to connect **LambdaTest Tunnel** successfully, you would just have to pass on tunnel capabilities in the code as shown:

```java title="Tunnel Capability"
DesiredCapabilities capabilities = new DesiredCapabilities();
        capabilities.setCapability("tunnel", true);
```
