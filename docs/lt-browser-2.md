<img loading="lazy" src={require('../assets/images/lt-browser-chromium/launched_web.png').default} alt="view screen"  className="doc_img" width="1365" height="727"/><br/><br/>

## Adding More Devices
---

You can monitor different devices side by side by adding a device on the view screen. With LT Browser 2.0, you can interact with 6 device viewports at a time.

1. To add more viewports, click **+ Add Devices**.

<img loading="lazy" src={require('../assets/images/lt-browser-chromium/add_device1.png').default} alt="view screen"  className="doc_img" width="819" height="392"/><br/><br/>

## Generating Performance Report
---

With LT Browser 2.0, you can view the performance report of your page instantly powered by Google Lighthouse. The Performance Report allows you to get a holistic view of your website or web app and gain actionable insights to improve your mobile web experience.

With Performance Report you can view:

* Desktop and Mobile Score

* Performance Metrics

* Runtime Settings

1. To generate a performance report, enter the desired URL in the address bar and press Enter.

2. Click on **Performance** tab in the header.

<img loading="lazy" src={require('../assets/images/lt-browser-chromium/perf_report.png').default} alt="view screen"  className="doc_img" width="1366" height="720"/><br/><br/>

It will take a few seconds for the Performance Report to generate.

### Desktop and Mobile Score

The Desktop and Mobile Score contains the universal score of the desktop and mobile scores. The score has three fields - Poor, Average, and Optimum.

<img loading="lazy" src={require('../assets/images/lt-browser-chromium/pr.png').default} alt="view screen"  className="doc_img" width="959" height="449"/><br/><br/>

### Performance Metrics

You can view Desktop and Mobile Score based on different parameters like Accessibility, Best Practices, SEO, and Progressive Web App (PWA). The Opportunities and Diagnostics section help you with guidelines to load your page faster.

<img loading="lazy" src={require('../assets/images/lt-browser-chromium/p_metrics.png').default} alt="view screen"  className="doc_img" width="946" height="645"/><br/><br/>

Towards the bottom, you can find the device resolution used to generate performance report along with the loading time. Also, view the DOM and Browser processing duration of your web page. These timestamps will change as per your choice of network simulation.

<img loading="lazy" src={require('../assets/images/lt-browser-chromium/diagonistics.png').default} alt="view screen"  className="doc_img" width="848" height="570"/><br/><br/>

<img loading="lazy" src={require('../assets/images/lt-browser-chromium/r_settings.png').default} alt="view screen"  className="doc_img" width="579" height="192"/><br/><br/>

You can also share your performance report with your team members via e-mail or a shareable link. To share you report, click the Share icon.

<img loading="lazy" src={require('../assets/images/lt-browser-chromium/share_perf_report.png').default} alt="view screen"  className="doc_img" width="1028" height="502"/><br/><br/>

## Network Throttling
---

LT Browser 2.0 allows you to test your mobile website view over different types of network connections, including fast 3G, slow 3G, online and even offline. You can change your network profile to test its functionality when exposed to different network environments.
