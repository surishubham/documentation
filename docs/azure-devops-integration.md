# Azure DevOps Integration
***

Azure DevOps, previously known as **VSTS: Visual Studio Team Services** â€“ A software developed by Microsoft Corporations to provide an IDE(Integrated Development Environment) for facilitating management & development regarding a software project. Azure DevOps provides a set of specific, cloud-based collaboration tools for developers, testers & software architects. So you can plan smarter and ship even faster with the help of effective collaboration. With their **Azure Pipelines** you can deploy your development to any Git provider cloud.

The LambdaTest Azure DevOps Integration allows you to create a work item directly in your project from LambdaTest platform. Push a bug, epic, task, story to your respective project anytime, even in the middle of your test session. The fields populated by you when marking as a bug through LambdaTest are displayed as information on the work item in Azure DevOps project for that testing instance.

:::info
We recently added support for custom fields to our integration. From now on, all required custom fields in your Azure Devops account will be visible in your bug marking form on lambdatest.
:::

**Azure DevOps Integration with LambdaTest, like all of our other integrations to 3rd party applications, is available for freemium as well as premium plan.**

## How To Integrate Azure DevOps With Your LambdaTest Account?

* * *

**Step 1:** Login to your LambdaTest account. You would need to have Admin or User level access to see and install integrations.

**Step 2:** Select **'Integration'** from the left navigation menu bar. This will guide you to a screen where you will find a list of 3rd party applications, available to integrate with your LambdaTest account.

**Step 3:** Click on **'Add'** under the block that says 'Azure DevOps'.

**Step 4:** As you hit **"INSTALL"**, you will be directed to a page where you have to provide your **Azure DevOps URL**, your **Azure DevOps Email** & your **Azure DevOps Access Token**. By doing so you will grant LambdaTest the access to your user-owned resources on Microsoft's Visual Studio Team Services account. This is necessary for authorization purpose between APIs of two different applications.

* **What is my Azure DevOps URL?**

**Azure DevOps URL** would be the domain name. Log into your Azure DevOps account and you will find it under your organization.

**Step 5:** If you are already inside a project in your Azure DevOps account, then you will find it in the URL. For example: https://dev.azure.com/ **salmank0856**

<img loading="lazy" src={require('../assets/images/azure-devops-integration/Screenshot-284.webp').default} alt="azure-devops-integration" width="1919" height="987" className="doc_img"/>

---
* **What is my Azure DevOps Email?**

In this field you need to specify the **email id** through which you sign into your **Azure DevOps account**.
* **What is my Azure DevOps Access Token?**
---
You can generate your Azure DevOps access token under **'Personal access tokens'** by clicking on setiings icon next to top right corner where your user avatar is displayed and click on **'+ New Token'**.

<img loading="lazy" src={require('../assets/images/azure-devops-integration/Screenshot-277.webp').default} alt="azure-devops-integration" width="1364" height="623" className="doc_img"/>

* **What are access tokens?**

Access tokens are strings with authorization key required to access an API. They are issued to the client server and are usually opaque. They are used for requesting access to protected, user-specific resources. Access tokens are vital from a security point of view & can be generated in different formats, depending upon security requirements specified on the resource server.

<img loading="lazy" src={require('../assets/images/azure-devops-integration/Screenshot-278.webp').default} alt="azure-devops-integration" width="1365" height="648" className="doc_img"/>

**Step 6:** After you click on **'+ New Token'**, mention a **name** for the access token. Define the **scopes** for authorizing access. By doing so, you will be providing the level of access you want to provide to any 3rd party API. For Lambdatest integration with Azure DevOps, select the radio button for **'Full access'** & click on **'Create'**.

<img loading="lazy" src={require('../assets/images/azure-devops-integration/Screenshot-279.webp').default} alt="azure-devops-integration" width="1365" height="650" className="doc_img"/>

* A token is generated, copy the token to your clipboard and make sure to store it safely with you.

<img loading="lazy" src={require('../assets/images/azure-devops-integration/Screenshot-280.webp').default} alt="azure-devops-integration" width="1350" height="544" className="doc_img"/>

Access tokens are just as important as your passwords and shall not be misplaced into wrong hands. If by any chance you lose it in future or it gets shared to someone whom you don't trust, then you can always revoke the token and create a new one.

For revoking a token, click on any personal access token and hit the **'Revoke'**.

<img loading="lazy" src={require('../assets/images/azure-devops-integration/Screenshot-281.webp').default} alt="azure-devops-integration" width="1365" height="537" className="doc_img"/>

**Step 7:** Enter your Azure DevOps URL, E-mail and Access token in the provided field and & press **Install**.

<img loading="lazy" src={require('../assets/images/azure-devops-integration/Screenshot-282.webp').default} alt="azure-devops-integration" width="1345" height="622" className="doc_img"/>

**Step 8:** Now, you will notice a success message as below.

<img loading="lazy" src={require('../assets/images/azure-devops-integration/Screenshot-275.webp').default} alt="azure-devops-integration" width="311" height="96" className="doc_img"/>

That's it! Go to Integrations again and you will be able to see Azure DevOps under 'My Integrations' section. You can now experience bug logging in a fly from any of your running test session in Lambdatest to your project directly by a single click.
