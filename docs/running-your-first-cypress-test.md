To demonstrate Cypress testing on the LambdaTest platform, we will use the [Cypress Cloud repo](https://github.com/LambdaTest/Cypress-Cloud) in the demo below.

**Step-1:** Clone the [LambdaTest-Cypress Cloud](https://github.com/LambdaTest/Cypress-Cloud) GitHub repo and switch to the cloned directory.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/LambdaTest/Cypress-Cloud.git
cd Cypress-Cloud
```

**Step-2:** Setup the **LambdaTest-Cypress CLI** and configure the configuration file, as shown in the pre-requisites before. A file named `lambdatest-config.json` is generated in your project using the below command:

```bash
lambdatest-cypress init
```

Here, we have used the below configuration as default and generated it in the `lambdatest-config.json` file. You need to set up the authentication by using LambdaTest credentials. You can check [here](https://www.lambdatest.com/support/docs/authentication/) for more details about authentication.

import Tabs from '@theme/Tabs';
import TabItem from '@theme/TabItem';

<Tabs className="docs__val">
  <TabItem value="config" label="lambdatest-config.json" default>

```json
{
  "lambdatest_auth": {
    "username": "<YOUR_LAMBDATEST_USERNAME>",
    "access_key": "<Your LambdaTest access key>"
  },
  "browsers": [
    {

  },
  "tunnel_settings": {

    "tunnelName": null
  }
}
```

  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

:::info
Also in `run-settings` section you need to specify the path of your `spec.js` file on which you want to run the test on. Here we will pass the path of a **sample to do** spec.js file for our demo.
:::

```json
"specs": "./cypress/integration/1-getting-started/todo.spec.js"
```

:::info Note
In this demo, all occurrences of **http://localhost:8080** have been replaced with [https://example.cypress.io](https://example.cypress.io) to prevent running the Cypress tests locally. Alternatively, if you want to run your tests locally, refer to the [**Run locally**](https://www.lambdatest.com/support/docs/running-your-first-cypress-test/#running-your-cypress-tests-locally-on-lambdatest-platform) section below.
:::

**Step-3:** Execute your tests using the following command in the terminal:

```bash
lambdatest-cypress run
```

## View Your Cypress Testing Results On LambdaTest Platform

---

As soon as the tests starts executing, you can view them running. Just visit your LambdaTest Automation Dashboard.

<img loading="lazy" src={require('../assets/images/cypress/cypress1.png').default} alt="Image" width="1282" height="722" className="doc_img"/>

:::tip info
For each test, you can view the live video feed, screenshots for each test run, console logs, terminal logs and do much more using the **LambdaTest platform**.

If the test gets executed successfully, you will see a green tick on the Timeline view and a **"Completed"** message on the Automation logs view of your Automation dashboard. If not, then you will see a red cross and a **"Failed"** message respectively.

## Running Your Cypress Tests Locally On LambdaTest Platform

---

To run your tests locally on the LambdaTest platform, you need to setup [LambdaTest tunnel](/docs/testing-locally-hosted-pages/), and execute commands using the CLI, or [Download UnderPass](/docs/underpass-tunnel-application/), our GUI based desktop app. Once you have the LambdaTest tunnel or Underpass set up and started, you can use the LambdaTest platform to run your Cypress tests locally.

Now you need to activate the tunnel capability in the `lambdatest_config.json` file under the section "connection_settings" as shown below:

```json title="lambdatest_config.json"
  "connection_settings": {
    "tunnel": true,
    "tunnel_name": "lt-cypress-tunnel"
  },
```

You can provide the name of the **LambdaTest tunnel** as per your requirements.
