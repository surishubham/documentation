This documentation will act as your step-by-step guide in to perform Playwright test with SmartUI.
- Basic understanding of Playwright is required.
- Go to [SmartUI](https://smartui.lambdatest.com/) and login along with your credentials.
- Copy `LT_USERNAME` and `LT_ACCESS_KEY` credentials from `Access Key` button on the top right of the dashboard.

<Tabs className="docs__val" groupId="language">
<TabItem value="MacOS/Linux" label="MacOS/Linux" default>

```bash
export LT_USERNAME="YOUR_USERNAME" 
export LT_ACCESS_KEY="YOUR ACCESS KEY"
```
</TabItem>
<TabItem value="Windows" label="Windows" default>

```bash
set LT_USERNAME="YOUR_USERNAME" 
set LT_ACCESS_KEY="YOUR ACCESS KEY"
```
</TabItem>
</Tabs>

The following steps will guide you in running your first Visual Regression test on LambdaTest platform -

### Step 1: Create a SmartUI Project

The first step is to create a project with the application in which we will combine all your **builds** run on the project.
To create a SmartUI Project, follow these steps:

1. Go to [Projects page](https://smartui.lambdatest.com/)
2. Click on the `new project` button
3. Select the platform as <b>Web</b> for executing your `PlayWright` tests. 
4. Add name of the project, approvers for the changes found, tags for any filter or easy navigation.
5. Click on the **Submit**.

### Step 2: Configure your test with Playwright Desired Capabilities

Once you have created a SmartUI Project, you can generate screenshots by running automation scripts. Follow the below steps to successfully generate screenshots -

1. Please clone the following sample Github repo 

```bash 
git clone https://github.com/LambdaTest/playwright-sample
```

2. Install the node modules using the command

```bash
npm i
```

3. Set up the LambdaTest credentials by using the commands below in the terminal.The account details are available on your [LambdaTest Profile](https://accounts.lambdatest.com/detail/profile) page.
   
For macOS:
```bash
export LT_USERNAME=LT_USERNAME
export LT_ACCESS_KEY=LT_ACCESS_KEY
```
For Linux:
```bash
export LT_USERNAME=LT_USERNAME
export LT_ACCESS_KEY=LT_ACCESS_KEY
```
For Windows:
```bash
set LT_USERNAME=LT_USERNAME
set LT_ACCESS_KEY=LT_ACCESS_KEY
```

1. Edit the required capabilities in your test file `playwright-smartui.js`.

```javascript title="Add the following code snippet to run SmartUI with Playwright in playwright-smartui.js file"
const { chromium } = require('playwright')
const { expect } = require('@playwright/test');

(async () => {
  const capabilities = {
    'browserName': 'Chrome', // Browsers allowed: `Chrome`, `MicrosoftEdge`, `pw-chromium`, `pw-firefox` and `pw-webkit`
    'browserVersion': 'latest',
    'LT:Options': {
      'platform': 'Windows 10',
      'build': 'Playwright Sample Build',
      'name': 'Playwright Sample Test',
      'user': process.env.LT_USERNAME,
      'accessKey': process.env.LT_ACCESS_KEY,
      'network': true,
      'video': true,
      'console': true,
      "smartUIProjectName": "<projectName>" //Add the required Smart UI Project name
    }
  }

  const browser = await chromium.connect({
    wsEndpoint: `wss://cdp.lambdatest.com/playwright?capabilities=${encodeURIComponent(JSON.stringify(capabilities))}`
  })

  const page = await browser.newPage()

  await page.goto('https://www.bing.com')
  // Add the following command in order to take screenshot in SmartUI 
 await page.evaluate((_) => {},
`lambdatest_action: ${JSON.stringify({ action: "smartui.takeScreenshot", arguments: { fullPage: true, screenshotName: "<Your Screenshot Name>" } })}`); // Add a relevant screenshot name here

  const element = await page.$('[aria-label="Enter your search term"]')
  await element.click()
  await element.type('LambdaTest')
  await element.press('Enter')
  const title = await page.title()

  try {
    expect(title).toEqual('LambdaTest - Search')
    // Mark the test as completed or failed
    await page.evaluate(_ => {}, `lambdatest_action: ${JSON.stringify({ action: 'setTestStatus', arguments: { status: 'passed', remark: 'Title matched' } })}`)
  } catch {
    await page.evaluate(_ => {}, `lambdatest_action: ${JSON.stringify({ action: 'setTestStatus', arguments: { status: 'failed', remark: 'Title not matched' } })}`)
  }

  await browser.close()
})()
```

- Execute the test using the following command

```bash
node playwright-smartui.js
```

- You can check the executed builds over at [LambdaTest SmartUI](https://smartui.lambdatest.com/).

## Fetching Screenshot Status and Results using WebHook <NewTag value='New' color='#000' bgColor='#ffec02' />



To retrieve the status and results of a captured screenshot, you can utilize the provided webhook. Follow the steps below to fetch this information:

```javascript
 // Add this code snippet within your script to fetch the screenshot status during runtime


response = await page.evaluate(_ => {}, `lambdatest_action: ${JSON.stringify({action: 'smartui.fetchScreenshotStatus', arguments: { screenshotName: "" }})}`)

console.log(response)
```
A sample response for the same can be seen below

```json
screenshotStatus response:  {
  screenshotsData: [
    {
      screenshotName: '<Your Screenshot Name>',
      screenshotURL: '<Link to the screenshot captured>',
      screenshotStatus: 'Approved', // current status of the screenshot
      approvedBy: 'system', // Approver details
      misMatchPercentage: 31.8, // percentage mismatch of the screenshot
      threshold: 5000, // Threshold set for the screenshot
      browserName: 'chrome', // Browser used for capturing the screenshot
      resolution: '1920x1080' // Resolution of the screenshot
    },
    
  buildId: '<Your Build ID>',
  projectName: '<Your Project Name>'
}
```
The following are the description of the parameters: 

| Parameter            | Description                                                   |
| -------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `screenshotName`     | Name of the screenshot for which the result is to be fetched. |
| `screenshotURL`      | URL of the screenshot captured.                               |
| `screenshotStatus`   | Status of the screenshot captured.                            |
| `approvedBy`          | Approver of the screenshot      |
| `misMatchPercentage` | Percentage of mismatch in the screenshot captured.            |
| `threshold`          | Threshold set for the screenshot captured.                    |
| `browserName`        | Browser used for capturing the screenshot.                    |
| `resolution`         | Resolution of the screenshot captured.                        |
| `buildId`            | ID of the build in which the screenshot was captured.         |
| `projectName`        | Name of the project in which the screenshot was captured.     |




By including the above code, you will be able to obtain the status of the captured screenshot. If you specify a particular `Screenshot Name`, the response will contain the result for that specific screenshot.

:::note

Please note that the screenshot name should be provided within the screenshotName argument.

  ...
   "smartUIProjectName": "<projectName>"
   "github": {
    "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/OWNER/REPO/statuses/commitId"
   }
  ...
}
```

## Advanced Options for Screenshot Comparison


  **Build Configuration** - If you have multiple screenshots running the same test suite and want to run the comparison for the same test suite, want to add a build as a baseline from your test suite or need to access more SmartUI Build Config Options, click [here](https://www.lambdatest.com/support/docs/smart-ui-build-options/).

  **Handling Dynamic Data** - In case if you have any dynamic elements that are not in the same position across test runs, you can ignore or select a specific area to be removed from the comparison. For accessing such HTML DOM Config and Options, click [here](/support/docs/html-dom-smartui-options/#configuration-for-playwright).
