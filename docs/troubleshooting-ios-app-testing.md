# Troubleshooting iOS App Testing
***

While uploading .app files on Simulators, you may come across an error on the LambdaTest platform - *No .app found inside zip*. In such cases, you may need to re-evaluate how you're building your iOS applications. To upload and test `. apps` files on Simulators, your iOS app need to be build for Simulators. 

Shown below are the steps for converting your `.app` file to a `.zip` file.

1. Download and install [Xcode](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/xcode/id497799835?mt=12).

2. Open your testing project in Xcode.

3. Head to **File** and click **Show in Finder** option to open the .app file once your build runs successfully.

4. Compress the `.app` file into a `.zip` file.

Your `.zip` file is now ready for upload on LambdaTest servers.

>**Note**: If you are unable to install the iOS zip file on the LambdaTest platform, you need to remove the arm64 architecture from both your project and the pod project.<br /> <br />
To do so, go to the **Build Settings** of your project. From **Excluded Architecture** dropdown, add any iOS Simulator SDK with value arm64 .<br /><br />
