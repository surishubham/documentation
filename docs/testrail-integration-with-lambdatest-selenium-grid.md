# TestRail Integration With LambdaTest Selenium Grid

***
TestRail is a modern test case management tool which offers a comprehensive web-platform for software testers and developers. Offering a JIRA add-on for cloud-based integration, TestRail helps you to track, manage, and hasten software release cycle.

TestRail also offers integration with LambdaTest to help you perform automated cross browser testing through an on-cloud Selenium Grid offering 3000+ browsers. **LambdaTest Selenium Grid integration to TestRail**  will help you run your Selenium automation scripts from TestRail instance to our cloud-based Selenium Grid.

## Prerequisites

1. Global Dependencies   
    * Make sure you have [Maven installed](https://maven.apache.org/install.html).
    * You could also install Maven with Homebrew with the below command:
        ```
        $ install maven
        ```

2. Project Dependencies

    * Clone our [GitHub repository for Selenium & TestRail](https://github.com/LambdaTest/Java-TestNG-Selenium-TestRail).
    * Ensure that the required packages are made available using the below command:
        ```
         $ cd Java-TestNG-Selenium-TestRail
         ```

    * We recommend, you execute the below command for evaluating any outdated dependencies. As a best practice, it is always suggested to go for a verification check & perform any update, if needed, prior editing your pom.xml in order to avoid any code incompatibility.
        ```
        mvn versions:display-dependency-updates
        ```

    * For authentication purpose, make sure you have your Testrail credentials – URL, Username and Password.

## Integrating LambdaTest With TestRail
***
**Step 1:**  Clone our [GitHub repository for Selenium & TestRail](https://github.com/LambdaTest/Java-TestNG-Selenium-TestRail).

**Step 2:**  Open Eclipse and import the cloned project as maven project.

**Step 3:**  Add Java Library into the project.

**Step 4:**  Follow the Readme.md file for how to run the test.

**Step 5:**  Once test would get run then find your result logged in Testrail for given test case and run id.

## Running Automation Scripts Using LambdaTest Selenium Grid & TestRail
***
**Step 1:**  Required JAVA files for TestRail integration are inside `package com.library.utils.testrail`.

**Step 2:**  In your test file you actually create an object of TestRailHandler like below:

```
TestRailHandler trh = new TestRailHandler(testrailusername,testrailpassword, testrailurl)
```

**Step 3:**  Then call it’s method as below:
```
trh.updateResultToTestRail(executionstatus, run_id, testcase_id);
```

**Step 4:**  In above arguments execution status is numeric number that denotes pass, fail statuses defined in TestRail. Example: Pass -> 1, Fail -> 5 etc.

**Step 5:**Use the below command to execute a single test.
```
//To run single test
$ mvn test -P single
```

Once Test gets run, it logs result in TestRail as output mentioned here:

```

Kudos! Now you can deploy your code in a reliable & faster manner at scale, using LambdaTest integration with TestRail, for automated cross browser testing with Selenium Grid. Happy Testing!
