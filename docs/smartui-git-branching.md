:::info
This is the guide to understand our Git Branching with SmartUI projects which can detect the commit history and execute the appropriate actions for your visual regression testing.
:::

### Pre-requisites for running Git with Smart UI

- You have an account with [Lambdatest](https://accounts.lambdatest.com).
- You must have an active [subscription](https://www.lambdatest.com/pricing) plan with valid screenshots limit.
- You must have created an Project on the SmartUI web app.

:::caution Warning
This feature is currently supported for only [**StoryBook**](/support/docs/smart-ui-storybook/) projects on the SmartUI platform. Please contact support@lambdatest.com for further information or requests.
:::

The following steps will guide you in running your Git branching Visual Regression test on LambdaTest SmartUI platform:

:::info
**Baseline Branch**: A baseline branch build is a set of screenshots which are captured using SmartUI where all the screenshots are compared against for the non-baseline branch builds.

**Non-Baseline Branches**: A non-baseline branch(s) build is a set of screenshots which are captured using SmartUI where all the screenshots are compared against with the **Baseline** build which are matched with the screenshot names.

:::

### **Step 1**: Setup your Git Baseline branch in the Project Settings

The following are the steps to add **Baseline** branch to your `StoryBook projects` with Git commits:

1. Go to **Project Settings** page for the created project.
2. Search for **Git Settings** and add your required **Baseline** branch in the input box.
3. Click on **Update Settings** button to update the project settings and set your **Baseline** Git branch.

<img loading="lazy" src={require('../assets/images/smart-visual-testing/git-settings.webp').default} alt="Smart Visual Testing" width="1600" height="803" className="doc_img"/>

Now, after the successful setup of your **Baseline** branch of your project.

### **Step 2**: Execute your SmartUI CLI with Git commits

The following are the steps to execute your SmartUI CLI with Git commits on StoryBook projects:

1. Go to your current **StoryBook** repository and run the following command:

```bash
git init --y
```

:::tip
You can ignore the above step if you already have a repository with `Git` initialized
:::

2. Now, make your changes in your `.stories` files and then commit the changes to your `Git`:

```bash
git commit -m "Your commit message"
```

3. Execute your **SmartUI StoryBook CLI** command to execute the Visual Regression tests for your `.stories` files:

<Tabs className="docs__val" groupId="execution_type">
<TabItem value="locally-hosted" label="For Locally Hosted Server" default>

```bash
npm run storybook                                                 // Starts your local StoryBook server
smartui storybook http://localhost:6006 --config .smartui.json    // Captures all the stories running on local server
```

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="static-build-or-ci" label="For Static Build">

```bash
npm run build-storybook                                           // Creates a Static Build Folder of StoryBook Stories
smartui storybook ./storybook-static --config .smartui.json       // Captures all the stories added in the static build folder
```

</TabItem>
</Tabs>

## Git Branching Workflows and Strategies

### Ability to set the **Baseline Branch**

You can set any `branch` name as your **Baseline** branch in the SmartUI project settings page. You can follow the steps below to set your baseline branch:

1. Go to the SmartUI Web App.
2. Select the project in which you want to configure the `Git` baseline branch for.
3. Go to the project settings section by clicking on the top right icon on the `Builds` list page.
4. In the project settings section you can provide the input of the `branch` name.
5. Click on the `Update Settings` button to update the settings.

:::caution Default Selection of Baseline Branch

In case, if there is no branch is set in your new or existing project created. Then, the `repository's` where SmartUI CLI command is executed to run the tests, **HEAD Branch** will be updated as the **Baseline** branch for that project by default.

:::

### Displaying the Git Commit Meta data

If you are using the `Git` based workflow with `SmartUI StoryBook CLI` then the following information is displayed on the UI of the SmartUI Web App - Builds list page:

- **Branch Name** is set as the `Build Name` in the SmartUI project.
- The latest **commit ID**of the Git commit added to the current repository.
- The **commit message** of the Git commit of the `commit ID` to the current repository.
- The commit author **username** of the Git commit to the current repository.

<img loading="lazy" src={require('../assets/images/smart-visual-testing/smartui-git-build-meta-data.webp').default} alt="Smart Visual Testing" width="1600" height="803" className="doc_img"/>

:::note

The above metadata is displayed only for StoryBook **Git** repositories.

:::

### Git Baseline Branch Selection and Comparison Strategy:

### Working on the same branch name

In this workflow, if you are working on the same branch name and want to execute the `SmartUI StoryBook CLI` command to run the Visual Regression tests for your `.stories`.

And, if you have created a project and set your **Baseline** branch name to `master` then executed the following commands:

```bash
// Your current branch name
$ git branch
* <Your Current Active branch>
  <--Other branches-->

// Adds a new commit to your current active branch
$ git commit -m "Your commit message"

// Executing the SmartUI StoryBook tests
$ smartui storybook <Your localhost URL or Static Build folder path> --config .smartui.json
```

Then, a new build will be created with your `Current Active Branch` on the SmartUI Web App - Build Lists page for the project in which the `SmartUI CLI` command is executed.

If the current Baseline build branch is set to `Current Active Branch` in the SmartUI project settings, then SmartUI will compare the screenshots captured to the latest `APPROVED` status build of the `Current Active Branch` branch available in the same project.

Here is an example of the above workflow:

```bash
$ git branch
* master

$ git commit -m "Second Build Changes"

$ smartui storybook http://localhost:6006 --config .smartui.json
```

<img loading="lazy" src={require('../assets/images/smart-visual-testing/git-working-on-same-branch.webp').default} alt="Smart Visual Testing" width="1600" height="803" className="doc_img"/>

### Updating the Baseline Branch Name

In this workflow, if you have created a SmartUI project on the Web App and have executed few builds with a `Branch Name: Master` and want to switch your **Baseline** branch to `development` branch in your `Git`, then following will be the workflow that will help you in switching the **Baseline Branch** for your project:

1. You have to go to the `SmartUI Project Settings` page to update your **Baseline Branch** in the project settings from `master` to `development`.
2. Make changes in your `.stories` folder files in your repository.
3. Now, execute the `SmartUI StoryBook` CLI command to run the Visual Regression tests.
4. Then, SmartUI algorithm will check for existing latest `build` with `development` run on the SmartUI project in Builds history.

The following are the cases that SmartUI will update the **Baseline** build for the branch set in your SmartUI project settings:

##### **Case 1**: If a build with development branch exists in build history

In this case, the latest build run on the SmartUI project build history will be updated as a **New Baseline Build** in which the new **Non-Baseline** builds will be compared against.

##### **Case 2**: If a build with development branch does not exist in build history

In this case, the new build run with the `development` git branch name will be set to the current **Baseline** build for the SmartUI project.

:::caution Note
For the first build generated for the **Baseline branch build** in the SmartUI Projects will be automatically set to **SYSTEM APPROVED** status by default.  
:::

<img loading="lazy" src={require('../assets/images/smart-visual-testing/git-updating-baseline-branch.webp').default} alt="Smart Visual Testing" width="1600" height="803" className="doc_img"/>

### Detect changes for Git commit added to **Baseline Branch**

In this workflow, if I make changes in the set Baseline branch in the Smart UI project that is master and make an commit to the Git then,

Execute `SmartUI Storybook CLI` commands to execute the `.stories` tests will compare the results with the latest **APPROVED** build run for **Baseline Branch** build in the SmartUI project.

<img loading="lazy" src={require('../assets/images/smart-visual-testing/git-compare-with-latest-build.webp').default} alt="Smart Visual Testing" width="1600" height="803" className="doc_img"/>

:::note
On approval of the all the screenshots then the new build will be updated as Baseline build for the baseline branch.
:::

Here is an example of the above workflow:

```bash
// Step 1 - Commit changes to Git
$ git commit -am "Changes in login stories"
(git) Changes added to your branch

// Step 2 - Execute SmartUI CLI to trigger Build in the SmartUI project
$ smartui storybook http://localhost:6006 --config .smatui.json
```

### Comparing Non-Baseline Branch builds with **Baseline** branch builds

In this workflow, if you want to compare a **non-baseline branch build** to a **baseline build** the following are steps to be followed:

Step 1: Checkout to a non-baseline branch in your `Git` repository.

Step 2: Then run the SmartUI CLI command to execute the tests should compare the screenshots captured of **Non-Baseline** branch build with the **Baseline branch** latest **APPROVED** build in the SmartUI project.

Here is an example of the above workflow:

```bash
// Baseline Branch
$ git branch
* master

// Non-Baseline branch
$ git checkout -b develop
* develop
  master

// Executing SmartUI Build with Non-Baseline Git branch
$ smartui storybook http://localhost:6006 --config .smartui.json
```

<img loading="lazy" src={require('../assets/images/smart-visual-testing/git-baseline-non-baseline.webp').default} alt="Smart Visual Testing" width="1600" height="803" className="doc_img"/>

### Auto Updating **Baseline** build for the **Baseline** branch

In this workflow, once all the `Changes Found` are approved by the `approver` for the screenshots in the **Baseline** branch's **Non-Baseline** build then the `latest` approved **Baseline Branch** build will be updated to the `Baseline`.

<img loading="lazy" src={require('../assets/images/smart-visual-testing/git-auto-update-baseline-build.webp').default} alt="Smart Visual Testing" width="1600" height="803" className="doc_img"/>

:::note
In case if the **Baseline** branch does not have an existing build then by default the new build run will be set as Baseline build.
:::

### Running Force Builds

In this workflow, If you have not added any commit to your current `Git` in the repository after making the changes then SmartUI will consider that no changes are made to your `.stories` files, then you will need to use the following command to execute the build:

```bash
$ smartui storybook <Your localhost URL or Static Build folder path> --config .smartui.json --force-rebuild
```

:::caution Warning
In the above workflow, if there are no changes which are committed to your `Git` repository and if a build with the same commit number already exists in the build history of the SmartUI project.
:::
