# Inside LambdaTest App Automation Dashboard
***

You can view your App automated test results on LambdaTest App Automation Dashboard. LambdaTest App Automation dashboard enables you to debug failed test sessions utilizing different test logs. The capabilities for a given test session may be specified in the test script and generated using the LambdaTest Capability Generator.

## Debugging Tests
***
LambdaTest allows you to debug and fix failed test cases using extensive test logs such as Appium logs, device logs, network logs, screenshots, and video logs.

1. **Device Logs**

Device logs allows you to capture system logs for Android and iOS apps. It allows the user to keep track of the application logs in case the application malfunctions.

Use the `devicelog` capability to enable the Device logs.

```java
capabilities.setCapability("devicelog", "true")
```

2. **Network Logs**

Network logs enables you to take screenshots of multiple network requests during testing and to monitor the performance of network requests and responses.

Use the `network` capability to enable the Network logs.

```java
capabilities.setCapability("network", "true")
```

3. **Appium Logs**

Appium logs allows you to capture the logs created by the Appium server during test execution, that include a comprehensive session log.

>**Note**: On LambdaTest platform, Appium logs are enabled by default.

4. **Visual Logs**

With Visual logs, you can capture the screenshots of the entire test session.

Use the `visual` capability to enable the Visual logs.

```java
capabilities.setCapability("visual", "true")
```

5. **Video Logs**

Visual logs enables you to record the video of the complete test session.

Use the `video` capability to enable the Video logs.

```java
capabilities.setCapability("video", "true")
```
