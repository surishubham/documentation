# Reports

Reports provide summarized job information, including status counts and links to tests. You can generate and download detailed reports at the end of job execution that helps you analyze the outcome of your tests based on your framework. 

## Steps to Generate Reports

Follow the below mentioned steps to generate the Reports for your desired framework:

**Step 1:** Go to the HyperExecute YAML file

**Step 2:** Add the below mentioned parameters in the YAML file to generate the Reports

- You must set the `report` flag to **true**.

- You will have to specify the **location**, **type** and **framework** associated with your report in the `partialReports` field to generate it. 

```bash
report: true
partialReports:
  frameworkName: testng
  location: target/surefire-reports/html
  type: html
```
> **Note**: If you do not specify a framework but you do mention the type of the report, then a report of the default framework is created.

**Step 3:** Now trigger your job and go to the [HyperExecute](https://hyperexecute.lambdatest.com/hyperexecute/jobs) dashboard.

**Step 4:** Click on the **Open** button of the **Reports**.
