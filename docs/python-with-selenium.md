# Python with Selenium: Tutorial to Run Your First Test on LambdaTest
***
This post will help you in getting started with configuring and running your Python-based automation test scripts on [LambdaTest Selenium cloud platform](https://www.lambdatest.com/selenium-automation).  

## Objective
***
By the end of this topic, you will be able to:

1. Set up an environment for testing your hosted web pages using **Python** with Selenium.
2. Understand and configure the core capabilities required for your Selenium test suite.
3. Test your locally hosted pages on LambdaTest platform.
4. Explore advanced features of LambdaTest.

>**Note:** All the code samples in this documentation can be found in the [LambdaTest's Repository on GitHub](https://github.com/LambdaTest/python-selenium-sample). You can either download or clone the repository to quickly run your tests.

## Prerequisites For Running Selenium Python Scripts
***

Before you can start performing **Python** automation testing with **Selenium**, you would need to:

* Install the latest Python build from the [official website](https://www.python.org/downloads/). We recommend using the latest version.
* Make sure **pip** is installed in your system. You can install **pip** from [https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/installation/](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/installation/).
* Download the latest **Selenium Client** and its **WebDriver bindings** from the [official website](https://www.selenium.dev/downloads/). Latest versions of **Selenium Client** and **WebDriver** are ideal for running your automation script on LambdaTest Selenium cloud grid.

### Installing Selenium Dependencies and Tutorial Repo

**Step 1:** Clone the LambdaTest’s [python-selenium-sample repository](https://github.com/LambdaTest/python-selenium-sample) and navigate to the code directory as shown below:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/LambdaTest/python-selenium-sample
cd python-selenium-sample
```
**Step 2:** Download the driver from the link, or you can use **pip** to install it.
```bash
pip install selenium
export PYTHONWARNINGS="ignore:Unverified HTTPS request"   //Disable ssl warning
```
### Setting up Your Authentication
Make sure you have your LambdaTest credentials with you to run test automation scripts on LambdaTest Selenium Grid. You can obtain these credentials from the [LambdaTest Automation Dashboard](https://automation.lambdatest.com/build) or through [LambdaTest Profile](https://accounts.lambdatest.com/login).

**Step 3:** Set LambdaTest `Username` and `Access Key` in environment variables.
  * For **Linux/macOS**:
  ```bash
  export LT_USERNAME="YOUR_USERNAME" export LT_ACCESS_KEY="YOUR ACCESS KEY"
  ```
  * For **Windows**:
  ```bash
  set LT_USERNAME="YOUR_USERNAME" set LT_ACCESS_KEY="YOUR ACCESS KEY"
  ```

## Run Your First Test
***
### Sample Test Case
Let’ start with a simple Selenium Remote WebDriver test first. The test automation script below tests a simple to-do application with basic functionalities like mark items as done, add items in a list, calculate total pending items etc.
```python
# google-search-lambdatest.py

import time
from selenium import webdriver
from selenium.webdriver.common.keys import Keys
from selenium.webdriver.chrome.options import Options
import os


"""
    LambdaTest selenium automation sample example
    Configuration
    ----------
    username: Username can be found at automation dashboard
    accessToken:  AccessToken can be generated from automation dashboard or profile section

    Result
    -------
    Execute Test on lambdatest Distributed Grid perform selenium automation based 
"""

# username: Username can be found at automation dashboard
username = os.getenv("LT_USERNAME")
# accessToken:  AccessToken can be generated from automation dashboard or profile section
accessToken = os.getenv("LT_ACCESS_KEY")
# gridUrl: gridUrl can be found at automation dashboard
gridUrl = "hub.lambdatest.com/wd/hub"


capabilities = {
    'LT:Options': {
        "build": "your build name",
        "name": "your test name",
        "platformName": "Windows 10"
    },
    "browserName": "Chrome",
    "browserVersion": "latest",
}

url = "https://"+username+":"+accessToken+"@"+gridUrl


"""
    ----------
    platformName : Supported platform - (Windows 10, Windows 8.1, Windows 8, Windows 7,  macOS High Sierra, macOS Sierra, OS X El Capitan, OS X Yosemite, OS X Mavericks)
    browserName : Supported platform - (chrome, firefox, Internet Explorer, MicrosoftEdge)
    browserVersion :  Supported list of version can be found at https://www.lambdatest.com/capabilities-generator/

    Result
    -------
"""

driver = webdriver.Remote(
    command_executor=url,
    desired_capabilities=capabilities
)

"""
	----------
	Execute test:  navigate google.com search LambdaTest
	Result
	----------
	print title
"""

driver.get("https://www.google.com/ncr")

print("Searching lambdatest on google.com ")
time.sleep(8)
elem = driver.find_element_by_name("q")
elem.send_keys("lambdatest.com")
elem.submit()

print("Printing title of current page :"+driver.title)
driver.execute_script("lambda-status=passed")
print("Requesting to mark test : pass")

"""
	Quit selenium driver
"""
driver.quit()
```

### Configuration of Your Test Capabilities

**Step 4:** In the python script, you need to update your test capabilities. In this code, we are passing browser, browser version, and operating system information, along with LambdaTest Selenium grid capabilities via capabilities object. The capabilities object in the above code are defined as:
```python
capabilities = {
        "build": "your build name",
        "name": "your test name",
        "platformName": "Windows 10"
        "browserName": "Chrome",
        "browserVersion": "latest",
}
```
> You can generate capabilities for your test requirements with the help of our inbuilt **[Capabilities Generator tool](https://www.lambdatest.com/capabilities-generator/)**.

### Executing the Test

**Step 5:** You would need to execute the below command in your terminal/cmd.
```bash
python google-search-lambdatest.py
```
Your test results would be displayed on the test console (or command-line interface if you are using terminal/cmd) and on LambdaTest automation dashboard. [LambdaTest Automation Dashboard](https://automation.lambdatest.com/build) will help you view all your text logs, screenshots and video recording for your entire automation tests.

## Testing Locally Hosted or Privately Hosted Projects
***
You can test your locally hosted or privately hosted projects with [LambdaTest Selenium grid cloud](https://www.lambdatest.com/selenium-automation) using LambdaTest Tunnel app. All you would have to do is set up an SSH tunnel using LambdaTest Tunnel app and pass toggle `tunnel = True` via desired capabilities. LambdaTest Tunnel establishes a secure SSH protocol based tunnel that allows you in testing your locally hosted or privately hosted pages, even before they are made live.

>Refer our [LambdaTest Tunnel documentation](https://www.lambdatest.com/support/docs/testing-locally-hosted-pages/) for more information.

Here’s how you can establish LambdaTest Tunnel.

>Download the binary file of:
>* [LambdaTest Tunnel for Windows](https://downloads.lambdatest.com/tunnel/v3/windows/64bit/LT_Windows.zip)
* [LambdaTest Tunnel for Mac](https://downloads.lambdatest.com/tunnel/v3/mac/64bit/LT_Mac.zip)
* [LambdaTest Tunnel for Linux](https://downloads.lambdatest.com/tunnel/v3/linux/64bit/LT_Linux.zip)

Open command prompt and navigate to the binary folder.

Run the following command:
```bash
LT -user {user’s login email} -key {user’s access key}
```
So if your user name is lambdatest@example.com and key is 123456, the command would be:
```bash
LT -user lambdatest@example.com -key 123456
```
Once you are able to connect **LambdaTest Tunnel** successfully, you would just have to pass on tunnel capabilities in the code shown below :

**Tunnel Capability**
```bash
"tunnel" : true
```
