# HyperExecute Security FAQs

***

#### 1. **How secure is HyperExecute?**

  HyperExecute is built with security at its core and provides industry standard security on the entire infrastructure. HyperExecute provides fresh virtual machines every time a new job is triggered and deletes the infrastructure after the test execution of the job is completed. Dozens of microservices ensure that test scripts are deleted after the retention period and uniquely encrypted during their retention period. HyperExecute uses a powerful vault to store client side secrets for the users. Enterprise version enables users to add their own security policies over the HyperExecute infrastructure.

***

#### 2. **Does HyperExecute provide the ability to define secrets?**

  Yes, HyperExecute provides a vault service to securely store client side secrets instead of hardcoding them in the yaml or test script files. In enterprise versions, organizations can pick the vault of their choice.

***

#### 3. **Whatâ€™s the retention period of logs on HyperExecute?**

  By default, HyperExecute has a retention period of 60 days where it keeps records and test execution logs. After the retention period, the logs and records are deleted permanently. Enterprise version allows a custom retention period to be defined.
