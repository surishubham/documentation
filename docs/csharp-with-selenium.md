 ```
 
 **For Windows**:
 
 ```
 set LT_USERNAME="YOUR_USERNAME" set LT_ACCESS_KEY="YOUR ACCESS KEY"
 ```

## Run Your First Test
---

The following C# Selenium script tests a sample to-do list app by marking couple items as done, adding a new item to the list and finally displaying the count of pending items as output.

 ```csharp
 using System;
    using OpenQA.Selenium;
    using static System.Environment;
    using OpenQA.Selenium.Safari;
    using OpenQA.Selenium.Chrome;
    using OpenQA.Selenium.Edge;
    using OpenQA.Selenium.Firefox;
    using OpenQA.Selenium.Remote;
    using OpenQA.Selenium.Support.UI;

    namespace csharp_selenium_lambdatest
    {
        class SingleTest
        {
            public static void execute()
            {
                // Update your lambdatest credentials
                String LT_USERNAME = GetEnvironmentVariable("LT_USERNAME");
                String LT_ACCESS_KEY =  GetEnvironmentVariable("LT_ACCESS_KEY");
                IWebDriver driver;
                ChromeOptions capabilities = new ChromeOptions();
                capabilities.BrowserVersion = "latest";
                Dictionary<string, object> ltOptions = new Dictionary<string, object>();
                ltOptions.Add("username", LT_USERNAME);
                ltOptions.Add("accessKey", LT_ACCESS_KEY);
                ltOptions.Add("platformName", "Windows 10");
                ltOptions.Add("project", "Demo LT");
                ltOptions.Add("build", "C# Build");
                ltOptions.Add("sessionName", "C# Single Test");
                ltOptions.Add("w3c", true);
                ltOptions.Add("plugin", "c#-c#");
                capabilities.AddAdditionalOption("LT:Options", ltOptions);

                driver = new RemoteWebDriver(new Uri("https://hub.lambdatest.com/wd/hub/"), capabilities);
                WebDriverWait wait = new WebDriverWait(driver, TimeSpan.FromSeconds(10));
                try
                {
                      Console.WriteLine("Navigating to todos app.");
                    driver.Navigate().GoToUrl("https://lambdatest.github.io/sample-todo-app/");

                    driver.FindElement(By.Name("li4")).Click();
                    Console.WriteLine("Clicking Checkbox");
                    driver.FindElement(By.Name("li5")).Click();

                    // If both clicks worked, then te following List should have length 2
                    IList<IWebElement> elems = driver.FindElements(By.ClassName("done-true"));
                    // so we"ll assert that this is correct.
                    if (elems.Count != 2)
                        throw new Exception();

                    Console.WriteLine("Entering Text");
                    driver.FindElement(By.Id("sampletodotext")).SendKeys("Yey, Let's add it to list");
                    driver.FindElement(By.Id("addbutton")).Click();

                    // lets also assert that the new todo we added is in the list
                    string spanText = driver.FindElement(By.XPath("/html/body/div/div/div/ul/li[6]/span")).Text;
                    if (!"Yey, Let's add it to list".Equals(spanText))
                        throw new Exception();
                    ((IJavaScriptExecutor)driver).ExecuteScript("lambda-status=passed");
                }
                catch
                {
                    ((IJavaScriptExecutor)driver).ExecuteScript("lambda-status=failed");
                }
                finally{  
                driver.Quit();
                }
            }
        }
    }
```


## Configuration of Your Test Capabilities
---

In the test script, you need to update your test capabilities. In this code, we are passing browser, browser version, and operating system information, along with LambdaTest Selenium grid capabilities via capabilities object. The capabilities object in the above code are defined as:

```csharp
 ChromeOptions capabilities = new ChromeOptions();
            capabilities.BrowserVersion = 'latest';
            Dictionary<string, object> ltOptions = new Dictionary<string, object>();
            ltOptions.Add("username", LT_USERNAME);
            ltOptions.Add("accessKey", LT_ACCESS_KEY);
            ltOptions.Add("platformName", "Windows 10");
            ltOptions.Add("project", "Demo LT");
            ltOptions.Add("w3c", true);
            ltOptions.Add("plugin", "c#-c#");
            capabilities.AddAdditionalOption('LT:Options', ltOptions);
```
> **Note:** You can generate capabilities for your test requirements with the help of our inbuilt **[Capabilities Generator](https://www.lambdatest.com/capabilities-generator/)**.

## Executing the Test
---

Following are the commands to run your single and parallel tests.

**Single test**

```csharp
dotnet run single
```

**Parallel test**

```csharp
dotnet run parallel
```

## Running your Parallel tests using .NET Runtime
---

To run your test in parallel using .NET Runtime, pass the following command in the terminal.

```csharp
dotnet run parallel
```

## Testing Locally Hosted or Privately Hosted Projects
***
You can test your locally hosted or privately hosted projects with [LambdaTest Selenium grid cloud](https://www.lambdatest.com/selenium-automation) using LambdaTest Tunnel app. All you would have to do is set up an SSH tunnel using LambdaTest Tunnel app and pass toggle `tunnel = true` via desired capabilities. LambdaTest Tunnel establishes a secure SSH protocol based tunnel that allows you in testing your locally hosted or privately hosted pages, even before they are made live.

>Refer our [LambdaTest Tunnel documentation](https://www.lambdatest.com/support/docs/testing-locally-hosted-pages/) for more information.

Hereâ€™s how you can establish LambdaTest Tunnel.

>Download the binary file of:
>* [LambdaTest Tunnel for Windows](https://downloads.lambdatest.com/tunnel/v3/windows/64bit/LT_Windows.zip)
* [LambdaTest Tunnel for Mac](https://downloads.lambdatest.com/tunnel/v3/mac/64bit/LT_Mac.zip)
* [LambdaTest Tunnel for Linux](https://downloads.lambdatest.com/tunnel/v3/linux/64bit/LT_Linux.zip)

Open command prompt and navigate to the binary folder.

Run the following command:
```bash
LT -user {userâ€™s login email} -key {userâ€™s access key}
```
So if your user name is lambdatest@example.com and key is 123456, the command would be:
```bash
LT -user lambdatest@example.com -key 123456
```
Once you are able to connect **LambdaTest Tunnel** successfully, you would just have to pass on tunnel capabilities in the code shown below :

**Tunnel Capability**
```bash
ltOptions.Add("tunnel", true);      
```
