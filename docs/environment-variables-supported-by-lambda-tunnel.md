# Environment Variables Supported By LambdaTest Tunnel

---

You can leverage these environment variables to define your proxy settings. If these proxy environment variables are set then the tunnel will automatically detect them. You can switch command-line flags through an environment variable or <b>.lt.yaml</b>==$0 file with the LambdaTest tunnel.
To configure the <b>.lt.yaml</b>, you can refer to the section [Leverage .lt.yaml file](/docs/advanced-tunnel-features/#leverage-ltyaml-file) of the documentation [Advanced LambdaTest Tunnel Features](/docs/advanced-tunnel-features/).

### What are Environment Variables?

---

Environment variables can be used in place of command-line flags. Each operating system has its compatibility in terms of environment variables. Command-line flags restrict environment variables from being bypassed. When available, the command-line flags always take priority.

Below is the following list of environment variables used by the LambdaTest Tunnel

| ENVIRONMENT VARIABLE               | DESCRIPTION                                                                                               | OPERATING SYSTEM                |
| ---------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------- |
| `http_proxy`<br />`HTTP_PROXY`     | LambdaTest tunnel uses the HTTP proxy `http://hostname:port`                                              | Windows, Mac OS, Linux          |
| `https_proxy`<br />`HTTPS_PROXY`   | LambdaTest tunnel uses the HTTPS proxy `https://hostname:port`                                            | Windows, Mac OS, Linux          |
| `no_proxy`<br />`NO_PROXY`         | Comma separated list of hosts to bypass proxy when using tunnel. Wild cards is supported for sub-domains. | Windows, Mac OS, Linux          |
| `LT_USERNAME`<br />`LT_ACCESS_KEY` | LambdaTest Username<br />LambdaTest Access Key                                                            | Windows, Mac OS, Linux, FreeBSD |
