> Katalon Studio Integration with HyperExecute enables cross-platform testing, from web automation on Windows, macOS, and Linux to mobile automation on Android and iOS.

It also comes with a built-in interface for codeless automation testing and validating the UI elements of your web application.

## Prerequisites

-   Ensure that you have integrated Katalon Studio with LambdaTest. Follow the steps on this [page](https://www.lambdatest.com/support/docs/katalon-integration-with-lambdatest/) to do so.
    
-   Ensure that you have the necessary licenses required to use Katalon Studio. You need the [Katalon Runtime License](https://docs.katalon.com/docs/legacy/products-and-licenses/katalon-studio-enterprise-and-runtime-engine-licenses/katalon-runtime-engine-floating-license) to integrate Katalon with HyperExecute. To learn more about these licenses, read this [page](https://docs.katalon.com/docs/legacy/products-and-licenses/katalon-studio-enterprise-and-runtime-engine-licenses/license-overview).

## Integrating Katalon Studio with HyperExecute

1. You must generate a command from Katalon to run it through the command line. To do so:

   a. Generate a command for Console mode through the Katalon UI. Click on the **Command Builder** button on the top of the screen. 

   <img loading="lazy" src={require('../assets/images/hyperexecute/integration/products/katalon/katalon1.png').default} alt="Image"  className="doc_img"/>

   b. Select the test suite that you want to use and click on **Generate Command**.

   c. Click on the **Copy to Clipboard** button to copy the command.

   <img loading="lazy" src={require('../assets/images/hyperexecute/integration/products/katalon/katalon2.png').default} alt="Image"  className="doc_img"/>

2. Clear the contents of the .gitignore file in the root directory of your Katalon project. 

3. Download the HyperExecute CLI binary in the root directory of your Katalon project. 

4. Create the hyperexecute.yaml file in the root directory of your Katalon project with the given parameters:

  ```bash
  version: 0.1
  globalTimeout: 90
  testSuiteTimeout: 90
  testSuiteStep: 90
  retryOnFailure: false
  maxRetries: 1
  runson: win
  pre: 
    - pip install requests # To install pip request
    - python installer.py # To install the certs in the Machine 

  tunnel: true
  tunnelOpts:
    global: true
  autosplit: true
  concurrency: 2
  testDiscovery:
    type: raw
    mode: dynamic
    command: grep -lr 'testSuiteGuid' */*.ts | sed 's/:.*//' | sed 's/.ts//g'
  testRunnerCommand:  katalonc `-noSplash `-runMode=console `-projectPath="G:\foreman\Hyperexecute_Sample\Hyperexecute_Sample.prj" `-retry=0 `-testSuitePath="$test" `-browserType="firefox" `-executionProfile="default" `-apiKey="aaa9402b-6a2e-4621-a4c3-05fe356f5aad" `-`-config `-webui.autoUpdateDrivers=true
  ```
  
Paste the command that you generated from the Katalon UI to fill the **testRunnerCommand** field in the _hyperexecute.yaml_ file.

5. Run the Hyperexecute CLI commands from the same path as your Katalon project. 


You have successfully integrated your Katalon Studio project with HyperExecute.
