# Mantis Integration

Mantis is a free and an open source bug tracker. Mantis supports multiple OS such as Windows, Linux, and macOS, from the server side. Along with platform compatibility, It also offers cross browser compatibility on Google Chrome, Mozilla Firefox, Opera, Safari and IE10+. Mantis is highly customizable, you can customize your issue fields, workflows and notifications. You can also declare access as per role based in your organization. All these features along with email notifications to keep you updated on everything regarding the project makes Mantis a great choice as a project management tool.

LambdaTest integration with Mantis helps you in filing issues to your project in Mantis directly from LambdaTest platform. With one-click integration you can push annotated issues to the project of your choice, assign it to the required team mate, and attach necessary screenshots. You can do all that while in the middle of a test session in LambdaTest platform. The fields populated by you when marking as bug through LambdaTest are displayed as information on the Mantis for a testing instance.

> Mantis Integration with LambdaTest, like all of the integrations to 3rd party applications, is available for freemium as well as premium plan.

## How To Establish Integration With Mantis From Your LambdaTest Account?
* * *
**Step 1:** Login to your LambdaTest account. You would need to have Admin or User level access to see and install integrations.

**Step 2:** Select ‘Integrations’ from the left navigation menu bar. This will guide you to a screen where you will find a list of 3rd party applications, available to integrate with your LambdaTest account.

**Step 3:** Click on ‘ADD’ under the block that says ‘Mantis’.

**Step 4:** Once you click on install, you will be redirected to the below screen. You will be asked to provide your Mantis API Token & Mantis Site Address in the highlighted fields to establish LambdaTest Integration with Mantis.

<img loading="lazy" src={require('../assets/images/mantis-integration/mantis-integration-7.webp').default} alt="Mantis integration API" width="1365" height="649" className="doc_img"/>

> **What is an API token?**
When two different applications interact with each other, a server-to-server communication is established. API token is needed for authenticating user identity from one server to another, by fetching user-owned resources available on the server from where the communication is initiated. API token has been a necessity for maintaining security and data integrity of any application. They are just as vital to an end user as they are to an application. API tokens are relevant if an end user logs in an application through a 2-step verification process.

> **What is Mantis Site Address?**
Your “Mantis Site Address” would be the URL for the instance of your project on Mantishub. The part highlighted with blue in the below image will be your Mantis Site Address.

<img loading="lazy" src={require('../assets/images/mantis-integration/mantis-integration-3.webp').default} alt="mantis integration" width="1366" height="768" className="doc_img"/>

**Step 5:** To find the API token, login to your MantisHub account. Go to the ‘administrator’ drop-down on the top-right corner and click on “My Account”.

<img loading="lazy" src={require('../assets/images/mantis-integration/mantis-integration-5.webp').default} alt="create api mantis" width="1364" height="649" className="doc_img"/>

**Step 6:** As you click on “My Account”, you will find a tab for “API Tokens”. Enter a value in the provided field. It could be any value you like and then click on the button that says “Create API Token”.

<img loading="lazy" src={require('../assets/images/mantis-integration/mantis-integration-6.webp').default} alt="Mantis integration Token" width="1365" height="649" className="doc_img"/>

**Step 7:** As you click on “Create API Token”, an API token would be generated. Keep the API token stored with you safely as you won’t be able to see it again.

<img loading="lazy" src={require('../assets/images/mantis-integration/mantis-integration-8.webp').default} alt="mantis integration api" width="1364" height="648" className="doc_img"/>

> Note: These API tokens should be treated as safely as you treat your own passwords, as they are responsible for successful authentication between one application to another. However, in case your API token gets misplaced or is shared with someone whom you don’t trust, then you can always revoke access through that API token through your MantisHub instance. You can also generate multiple API tokens.

<img loading="lazy" src={require('../assets/images/mantis-integration/mantis-integration-4-2.webp').default} alt="mantis integration account" width="1365" height="649" className="doc_img"/>

Paste this API token into the field provided at LambdaTest & hit the ‘Next’ button. You are all set to experience one-click bug logging to share your issues directly from your LambdaTest account to your project on Mantis.

<img loading="lazy" src={require('../assets/images/mantis-integration/mantis-integration-9.webp').default} alt="Mantis integration install" width="1365" height="649" className="doc_img"/>

That’s it! Go to Integrations again and you will be able to notice a green tick indicating that Mantis is successfully installed.
