# Tosca Integration using Commander

This documentation provides a detailed guide on seamlessly integrating Tosca with HyperExecute.

## Pre-requisite: 
    
-  To run Tosca, ensure that you have all the required [licences](https://documentation.tricentis.com/tosca/1600/en/content/licensing/lic_administering_licenses.htm).

## Integrate Tosca with HyperExecute

To Integrate Tosca with HyperExecute, follow the below mentioned steps:

**Step 1:** Go to the [HyperExecute Dashboard](https://hyperexecute.lambdatest.com/). Click on the **Projects**.

**Step 2:** Click on the **Setup a New Project** button.

**Step 3:** Enter your **Project Name**. Click on Continue.

<img loading="lazy" src={require('../assets/images/hyperexecute/integration/products/tosca/tosca-commander/Step3.webp').default} alt="Image" width="1365" height="650" className="doc_img"/>

**Step 4:** Enter the **License Details**, i.e. Username and Password with which you want to execute your tests.

<img loading="lazy" src={require('../assets/images/hyperexecute/integration/products/tosca/tosca-commander/Step4.webp').default} alt="Image" width="1365" height="650" className="doc_img"/>

**Step 5:** Now select your **Database Type**. For the demo purpose, we are using Oracle. Choose how you want to establish the connection, i.e, **via Connection Data** or **via Connection String**, to access the common repository associated with your workspace. For demo purposes, we are selecting the **Connection String**. Enter the connection string for your database.

Enter the **Workspace Details**, i.e., Username (mandatory) and Password (optional), that you want to use for this project. Click on the **Save** button.

<img loading="lazy" src={require('../assets/images/hyperexecute/integration/products/tosca/tosca-commander/Step5.webp').default} alt="Image" width="1365" height="650" className="doc_img"/>

**Step 6:** Please wait for the discovered execution list to get populated. Now, select the desired tests that you want to execute, and then click on the **Run** button.
<img loading="lazy" src={require('../assets/images/hyperexecute/integration/products/tosca/tosca-commander/Step6.webp').default} alt="Image" width="1365" height="650" className="doc_img"/>

**Step 7:** Now set the total number of **Concurrent Sessions** that you want to run on HyperExecute and click on the **Run** button.
<img loading="lazy" src={require('../assets/images/hyperexecute/integration/products/tosca/tosca-commander/Step7.webp').default} alt="Image" width="1365" height="650" className="doc_img"/>

**Step 8:** Now go to the [**Jobs**](https://hyperexecute.lambdatest.com/hyperexecute/jobs) section and check the results.
<img loading="lazy" src={require('../assets/images/hyperexecute/integration/products/tosca/tosca-commander/Step8.webp').default} alt="Image" width="1365" height="650" className="doc_img"/>

> Results will get updated in the **Common Repository** once execution is completed on HyperExecute. The live video of running tests can be viewed from the [HyperExecute job-detail](https://hyperexecute.lambdatest.com/hyperexecute/jobs)dashboard.

## Integrate Tosca with HyperExecute using YAML

To Integrate Tosca with HyperExecute using YAML, follow the below mentioned steps:

#### Prerequisite

-  Ensure that you have integrated Tosca with [LambdaTest’s cloud-based Selenium Grid](https://www.lambdatest.com/support/docs/tricentis-tosca-integration-lambdatest-selenium-grid/).

**Step 1:** Create an Execution List:

- Go to the execution tab in your Tosca commander to [create an execution list](https://documentation.tricentis.com/tosca/1510/en/content/tosca_commander/execution_lists_section.htm).
    
- You can drag and drop test cases from the **Test Cases** tab to the execution list. In the example given below, the execution list is called LT.

<img loading="lazy" src={require('../assets/images/hyperexecute/integration/products/tosca/tosca-commander/Tosca1.png').default} alt="Image"  className="doc_img"/>

**Step 2:** Create a **TC-Shell Script**:

- A TC-Shell script file usually has the extension _.tcs_, and it contains a sequence of [TC-Shell commands](https://documentation.tricentis.com/tosca/1300/en/content/tosca_commander/tcshell_commands.htm#TC-Shell_&_Keyboard_Shortcuts_699197005_998491) in plain text to configure the steps to execute a Tosca test via command line. This script file is kept in the same folder where you have the actual Tosca project saved.

<img loading="lazy" src={require('../assets/images/hyperexecute/integration/products/tosca/tosca-commander/Tosca2.png').default} alt="Image"  className="doc_img"/>

- **Sample TC-Shell Script:**

```bash
//script

jumptonode "/Execution/ExecutionLists/LT"

// reset actual log
task "clear log"

//start execution list
task run

//save results
save
```

- Click the arrow on the right side of the **Execution** tab to retrieve the node path used in **jumptonode** command.

<img loading="lazy" src={require('../assets/images/hyperexecute/integration/products/tosca/tosca-commander/Tosca3.png').default} alt="Image"  className="doc_img"/>

- The node path is highlighted in the image below. 

<img loading="lazy" src={require('../assets/images/hyperexecute/integration/products/tosca/tosca-commander/Tosca4.png').default} alt="Image"  className="doc_img"/>

- Use the following command to execute this test via command line. 

```bash
- TCShell.exe -workspace <Path to your tosca workspace file> -login <your email here> <your password here> "<Path to TC-Shell Script>"
```

**Step 3:** After configuring the TC-Shell Script, integrate it with HyperExecute. To do this:
    
- Create a Hyperexecute YAML.
        
- Download the Hyperexecute CLI Binary based on the OS you use:

| Platform | Download Link |
| ---------| --------------------------- |
| Windows | https://downloads.lambdatest.com/hyperexecute/windows/hyperexecute.exe |
| macOS | https://downloads.lambdatest.com/hyperexecute/darwin/hyperexecute |
| Linux | https://downloads.lambdatest.com/hyperexecute/linux/hyperexecute |

> The binary for Mac is unsigned. You might get a permission denied warning while executing on mac and linux machines. To allow permissions you can use the following command: `chmod u+x ./hyperexecute`. <br />
Thus, you might see a security popup on whether to allow the execution of the tool or not. You can allow it from your **System Preferences** → **Security & Privacy** → **General** tab.

  **Sample Hyperexecute YAML file for TOSCA**:
  ```bash
---
version: "0.1"
matrix:
  os: [win]
runson: ${matrix.os}

retryOnFailure: true
maxRetries: 2

pre:
  - PATH=%TRICENTIS_LICENSING_HOME%;%PATH% && ToscaLicenseConfiguration.exe connect-cloud -u <your_email_here> -p <your_password_here>

testSuites:
  - TCShell.exe -workspace D:\foreman\<Project_Folder_Name>\Demo_Sample.tws -login <your email here> <your password here> "D:\foreman\<Path to TC-Shell Script>"

post:
  - cat hyex_tosca.yml

uploadArtefacts:
  - name: Logs
    path:
      - Demo_Sample/**

```
> Each machine has a Tosca commander Client installed on HyperExecute. To successfully run your tests, your Tosca licenses must be pre-configured on the machine. To do so, we use the **ToscaLicenseConfiguration.exe** along with the **connect-cloud** parameter to validate the licenses as a **pre-step** before triggering the tests. The complete command is added under **pre** in the above sample.

- After configuring the YAML, execute it via terminal using the following command:

```bash
./hyperexecute --user <your_username> --key <your_access_key> --config <your_yaml_file_name>
```

You have successfully integrated your Tricentis Tosca project with HyperExecute.
