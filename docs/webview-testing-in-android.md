# WebView Testing In Android Online In Real Time

* * *

WebView, in Android, is the feature which allows any app to display a webpage as a part of its own activity, instead of opening it on a separate browser. This not only allows the app to retain the users within itself but also increases the user-experience multifold. As a result, WebView Testing is one of the most widely in-demand testing techniques around the world as of today.

LambdaTest now allows you to perform your WebView Testing using its online cloud-based Selenium Grid, which gives you 3000+ combinations of browsers, operating systems, and mobile devices. You will be able to test WebViews of your app, interact with it in realtime, mark bugs, and much more, with just a click, on the LambdaTest platform. In this article, we will see how to perform WebView Testing in Android using Selenium Grid on LambdaTest.

>Note: This is not our primary offering, as of now. Hence you need to launch WebView manually, using the steps mentioned in this doc.

## How To Perform WebView Testing On LambdaTest

* * *

**Step 1:** You will need an account on LambdaTest. If you already have an account on LambdaTest, you can directly skip to the next step. If you don't have an account yet, you can [register for free](https://accounts.lambdatest.com/register).

**Step 2:** Login to your LambdaTest account using [this link](https://accounts.lambdatest.com/login).


**Step 3:** Navigate to "Real Time Testing" from the left navigation menu. <img loading="lazy" src={require('../assets/images/uploads/1-1.webp').default} alt="real time testing" width="1922" height="870" className="doc_img"/>

**Step 4:** Inorder to launch an Android device, select the _Mobile icon_ from the Device options, followed by _Android icon_ from the OS options. Then you can select the _Brand_, _Screen size along with Android version_ and _Browser_ as per your choice. For this demo purpose, we have selected **Samsung + Galaxy Note 10 with Android 9.0 + Chrome browser**, as shown in the image below: <img loading="lazy" src={require('../assets/images/uploads/2-3.webp').default} alt="mobile devices" width="1921" height="873" className="doc_img"/>

>Please note that we allow WebView Testing as of now in devices with Android version 9.0 and below.

**Step 5:** Once you have selected the desired options for the virtual machine, click on **Start** to launch it. <img loading="lazy" src={require('../assets/images/uploads/3-2.webp').default} alt="start button" width="1981" height="783" className="doc_img"/>

**Step 6:** Wait for the VM to be launched. It might take few seconds. <img loading="lazy" src={require('../assets/images/uploads/4-1.webp').default} alt="launching real time testing" width="1273" height="566" className="doc_img"/>

**Step 7:** Once the VM has launched successfully, an Android device, as per the chosen configuration will open on your screen. <img loading="lazy" src={require('../assets/images/uploads/5-2.webp').default} alt="VM" width="1421" height="838" className="doc_img"/>

**Step 8:** Then press the _home button_ at the bottom center of the device to go the device's home screen. <img loading="lazy" src={require('../assets/images/uploads/6-1.webp').default} alt="home button" width="1117" height="773" className="doc_img"/>

**Step 9:** In order to perform the WebView Testing, on the home screen, press the _Android icon_ to open the device's WebView Browser Tester. <img loading="lazy" src={require('../assets/images/uploads/7-2.webp').default} alt="android browser" width="1038" height="776" className="doc_img"/>

**Step 10:** Once the **WebView Browser Tester** is open, you can perform your WebView Testing as per your requirement. <img loading="lazy" src={require('../assets/images/uploads/8-1.webp').default} alt="WebView Browser Tester" width="1018" height="780" className="doc_img"/>

## How To Mark Bug While Performing WebView Testing On LambdaTest

* * *

**Step 1:** Open the WebView Browser Tester as per the steps given above.

**Step 2:** Enter the desired URL upon which you want to perform the WebView Testing. <img loading="lazy" src={require('../assets/images/uploads/9-1.webp').default} alt="webview testing" width="335" height="389" className="doc_img"/>

**Step 3:** Once the webpage loads and you find a bug, select the **Mark as bug** option from the left toolbar. <img loading="lazy" src={require('../assets/images/uploads/10-1.webp').default} alt="mark as bug" width="350" height="389" className="doc_img"/>

**Step 4:** A window will appear on your screen with several options to highlight the bug and mark it. <img loading="lazy" src={require('../assets/images/uploads/11-1.webp').default} alt="bug appearance" width="1699" height="745" className="doc_img"/>

**Step 5:** Scroll the are of the screen where you have found a bug. Highlight it using designs, texts, colors, etc from the options available on the left toolbar. Once you have completed the highlight, you can click on the **Mark as bug** button on the bottom right of the window. <img loading="lazy" src={require('../assets/images/uploads/12-1.webp').default} alt="mark as bug" width="1675" height="746" className="doc_img"/>

**Step 6:** A dialog box will appear on the screen asking you to fill required details about the bug, such as:

*   **Assignee:** Assign the person to whom you want to transfer the responsibility of the bug.
*   **Issue Type:** Select the type of the issue, whether it is a bug or a task.
*   **Priority:** Set the priority of the bug, from Lowest to Highest, as per your convenience.
*   **Summary:** Set the summary of the bug as per your choice. It will help the assignee to know about the bug in one read.
*   **Description:** This is an optional section, in which you can describe the bug in detail and include other relevant information, as per your choice.

For this demo purpose, we have set the required details as shown in the image below. Once you have filled the details, press **Create Issue** at the bottom to create the issue. <img loading="lazy" src={require('../assets/images/uploads/13-1.webp').default} alt="create issue" width="690" height="782" className="doc_img"/>

These steps will mark the bug successfully. You can a message appearing on your top right screen showing you that the bug has been marked successfully. <img loading="lazy" src={require('../assets/images/uploads/14-1.webp').default} alt="bug mark" width="500" height="103" className="doc_img"/>
