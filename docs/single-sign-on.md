# Getting Started With Single Sign On (SSO)

* * *

Single sign-on is an authentication feature that allows you to access multiple applications with one set of login credentials. Once you log in, you don't need to login repeatedly for every application linked to a particular application. LambdaTest supports Security Assertion Markup Language (SAML) that allows you to create a team account and authenticate to the LambdaTest dashboard with Identity Provider (IdP).

> SSO is supported in our Enterprise Plans. Please reach out to your account manager or [support@lambdatest.com](mailto:support@lambdatest.com) for questions.

## Benefits Of Authenticating Single Sign On (SSO)

* * *

Here are the following benefits of authenticating a Single sign-on to the LambdaTest dashboard.

*   **Security Enhancements**: Your team members can access the LambdaTest dashboard directly without creating a password. Also, you can leverage several authentication decisions provided by an identity provider(IdP) like security protocols, multi-factor authentication, etc.

*   **Easy to manage**: SSO consolidates passwords and user data, making it easier to access different platforms and resources. New team members can leverage Just-in-Time account provisioning to leverage login to the LambdaTest dashboard instantly. Also, with Just-in-Time (JIT), you can revoke LambdaTest dashboard access from one central place.

## Feature Of Single Sign On (SSO)

* * *

LambdaTest provides the support for the below Single sign-on features.

*   **Configure SSO**: You can configure SSO through multiple options. You can set up LambdaTest accounts to enable SSO for all team members or enable sign-in using SSO or by email and password.

*   **Just-in-Time Provisioning**: Just-in-Time provisioning automates user account creation when the user first tries to perform SSO and the user doesn't have an existing LambdaTest account.

*   **Identity provider(IdP-initiated) SSO**: You can directly authenticate with identify service provider like Okta, OneLogin, Azure AD. You need to ensure that the identity provider supports the Service Provider(SP-initiated) SSO.
