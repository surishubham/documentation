# Hive Integration
***
Hive is an online project management application that aims at maximizing your workplace productivity. With Hive you can plan project flexible and organize them in a Gantt chart, kanban board, table, or calendar. You can also keep a check on multiple projects simultaneously using their views and they also offer summary views to help you combine several projects in a single space, so you can visualize where all the teams are headed. LambdaTest integration with Hive helps to manage your bugs in Hive by moving them into a project through a single click effort. All the details you provide in LambdaTest like task list, assignee, title and description would automatically be presented in the project on Hive.

The LambdaTest Hive integration helps you in filing issues to your project in Hive directly from LambdaTest platform. With one-click integration, you can push annotated issues to the project of your choice, assign it to the required teammate, and attach necessary screenshots. You can do all that while in the middle of a test session in LambdaTest platform. The fields populated by you when marking as a bug through LambdaTest are displayed as information on the Hive for a testing instance.

> Hive Integration with LambdaTest, like all of the integrations to 3rd party applications, is available for freemium as well as premium plan.

## How To Establish Integration With Hive From Your LambdaTest Account?
***
**Step 1:** Login to your LambdaTest account. You would need to have Admin or User level access to see and install integrations.

**Step 2:** Select ‘Integrations’ from the left navigation menu bar. This will guide you to a screen where you will find a list of 3rd party applications, available to integrate with your LambdaTest account.

**Step 3:** Click on ‘ADD’ under the block that says **‘Hive’**.

**Step 4:** Once you click on install, you will be redirected to the below screen. You will be asked to provide your Hive User ID and your Hive API Key credentials in the highlighted fields to establish integration with LambdaTest.

<img loading="lazy" src={require('../assets/images/hive-integration/hive-2.webp').default} alt="credentials" width="1365" height="649" className="doc_img"/>

> **What is an API key?**
When two different applications interact with each other, a server-to-server communication is established. API key is needed for authenticating user identity from one server to another, by fetching user-owned resources available on the server from where the communication is initiated. API key has been a necessity for maintaining security and data integrity of any application. They are just as vital to an end user as they are to an application. API keys are relevant if an end user logs in an application through a 2-step verification process.

**Step 5:** You can find your Hive User ID & API key from your Hive workspace. Click the display picture on the top right and go to **Edit profile**.

<img loading="lazy" src={require('../assets/images/hive-integration/prof.webp').default} alt="api informantion" width="1365" height="643" className="doc_img"/>

**Step 6:** Click **API info** from the left menu.

<img loading="lazy" src={require('../assets/images/hive-integration/info.webp').default} alt="api key" width="1365" height="649" className="doc_img"/>

**Step 7**: Copy your **API Key** and **User ID**.

<img loading="lazy" src={require('../assets/images/hive-integration/api.webp').default} alt="api key and ID" width="1364" height="652" className="doc_img"/>

> You can keep a note of this API key with you for future authentication. Although, in case you forget to do so, or you end up neglecting it due to some reason. Then there is no need to panic! You can always regenerate the key.

**Step 8:** Paste the copied strings on the field provided at LambdaTest & hit the ‘Next’ button and you are all set to experience one-click bug logging to share your issues directly from your LambdaTest account to your project on Hive.

<img loading="lazy" src={require('../assets/images/hive-integration/hive-6.webp').default} alt="bug logging" width="1364" height="637" className="doc_img"/>

That’s it! Go to Integrations again and you will be able to notice a green tick indicating that Hive is successfully installed.

## How To Log Your First Bug Through Hive Integration?
***
**Step 1:** Go for any of the test from the left navigation menu. For demo, we will be taking “Real Time Test” option.

**Step 2:** Present a URL of the web-app you need to test in the dialog box. After that, select any configuration for browser and operating system of your choice & hit ‘Start‘.

<img loading="lazy" src={require('../assets/images/hive-integration/jira-1.webp').default} alt="start" width="1365" height="660" className="doc_img"/>

**Step 3:** After the VM is launched and operable. You can perform testing on your web-app for finding bugs. If a bug gets revealed, then you need to click on the Bug icon from the left panel for [capturing a screenshot](https://www.lambdatest.com/full-page-screen-capture) of the same. We have highlighted that controller button in the below image.

<img loading="lazy" src={require('../assets/images/hive-integration/Capture9-3.webp').default} alt="bug icon" width="1348" height="619" className="doc_img"/>

**Step 4:** After a screenshot is captured, you can annotate any issue or a task with an in-built image editor. Once you are done highlighting the bug, click on the button that says “Mark as Bug”.

<img loading="lazy" src={require('../assets/images/hive-integration/Capture13.webp').default} alt="mark as bug" width="1320" height="618" className="doc_img"/>

**Step 5:** After clicking on “Mark as Bug” button a Hive specific form would open up. Fill the fields as per your requirement.

---

* You can set the relevant Workspaces for your UI observation.
* You can select which project should the task go under.
* You can assign the bug to a colleague by populating the field ‘Assignee‘.
* You can mention the Title as well to easily organize your bugs.
* You also get to post a description to help relate the cause of the issue or the task.

**Step 6:** Click on “Create Bug” & observe it being successfully marked through a single click effort. Once you hit the button, you will get prompt messages on top of your Virtual Machine indicating the progress of bug logging. You will get a prompt message in few seconds mentioning **“Bug successfully marked”** indicating that the issue has been successfully pushed to the respective workspace.

**Step 7:** Visit your Hive dashboard. You will be able to notice the logged issue right away by going to the particular project and task list you assigned it to!

As you click on the task you will notice that all the data you provided through LambdaTest would already be presented in it. LambdaTest automatically includes test environment details and related screenshots in the task as attachments.

## How To Uninstall Hive Integration?
***
> You can work with one integration at a time. So if you would want to integrate to a similar 3rd party application, then you would have to `uninstall` your current integration. Here is how you can do that.

**Step 1:** Login to your LambdaTest account.

**Step 2:** Select ‘Integration’ from the left navigation menu bar. This will guide you to a screen where you will find 3rd party applications, available to integrate with your LambdaTest account.

**Step 3:** Click on `‘Remove’`. You can find the remove button right under the ‘Hive’ block which would be highlighted with a green tick.

<img loading="lazy" src={require('../assets/images/hive-integration/hive-12.webp').default} alt="remove" width="1343" height="645" className="doc_img"/>
