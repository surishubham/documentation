In this documentation, we look at how to integrate Linear App with LambdaTest and mark and share bugs from LambdaTest to Linear App projects.

## How To Integrate Linear App With Your LambdaTest Account?
***

1. Login to your LambdaTest account. To install integrations, you need to have admin or user level access.

2. Visit 'Integrations' from the left menu bar. Once you are in the integration page, select **LINEAR APP** under the **BUG TRACKER** category.

>**Note**: If you already have a LambdaTest integration with any project management tool then you will be asked to uninstall the existing LambdaTest integration.

3. You will be asked to enter your Linear App **API Token**.

>
*   **What is an API Token?**<br/>
An API token is needed to validate a user's identity from one server to another by retrieving client resources from the server where the connection is made. API tokens are essential when an end user interacts to an application via a two-step verification process to ensure its security and data integrity.
