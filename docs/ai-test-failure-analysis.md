## Why Test Failure Analysis?

Conventional test failure resolution demands manual analysis of logs and data sources, resulting in substantial delays. These inefficiencies hinder productivity and disrupt software development.

HyperExecute's AI-powered Test Failure Analysis seamlessly addresses these challenges, offering a proactive approach to identifying and fixing test case failures along with other benefits including:

- **Reduced time to identify and fix failures:** The AI-powered analysis can quickly identify the root cause of failures, so you can take corrective action quickly and efficiently. This can save you a significant amount of time, which can be used to focus on other tasks.

- **Improved accuracy of failure analysis:** The AI-powered analysis is more accurate than manual analysis, which can help you to identify and fix failures more effectively. This can lead to a higher quality product.

- **Increased productivity of testing teams:** The AI-powered analysis can free up testing teams to focus on other tasks, such as creating new test cases or debugging code. This can lead to a more efficient testing process.

## Generate the RCA of your failed Jobs

To use the AI-powered Test Failure Analysis feature, simply click on the Failure Analysis" (Beta) tab of your failed Job. Click on the **Generate RCA** Button. This usually takes around 20-30 seconds to generate the RCA.

After categorizing errors, we offer a structured approach to address each failure type. You can efficiently get to the precise corrective measures or **Remedies** recommended alng with **Additional suggestions** for the particular error. This targeted approach expedites the issue resolution process, eliminating unnecessary steps and optimizing efficiency.
