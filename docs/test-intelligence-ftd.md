## Introduction

Flaky Test Detection helps you to identify the flaky tests in your test suite. It provides you with the list of tests that are flaky and the reason behind the flakiness <img src={require('../assets/images/test-intelligence/flake-icon.webp').default} alt="flake icon" width="16" /> of the test. You can also view the history of the flaky tests and the number of times the test has failed in the past. This helps you to identify the flaky tests and fix them to improve the quality of your test suite. 

Flaky Test Detection serves various use cases, including:

1. **Identifying Flaky Tests:** Detecting tests that produce inconsistent results due to environmental factors, manual errors or other factors.
2. **Improving Test Reliability:** Providing insights into the reliability of your automated tests.
3. **Identifying Sources of Flakiness:** Pinpointing potential sources of flakiness, such as specific commands within a test.
4.  **<NewTag value='New' color='#000' bgColor='#ffec02' /> [Customization:](/support/docs/test-intelligence-flakiness-test-detection/#customizing-flaky-test-detection-)** Allowing you to tailor Flaky Test Detection settings to your specific testing environment and requirements.
5. **Flaky Test Analytics:** Analysing the flaky tests and the number of times the test has changed in the past with pattern analysis using Flaky Test Analytics.

## How to use Flaky Test Detection?

There are following pre-requisites to use Flaky Test Detection:

- You should have a LambdaTest account. If you don't have one, you can sign up [here](https://accounts.lambdatest.com/register).
- You should have a test suite with same test name run on the platform at least 10 times.

## How does the Flaky Test Detection work?
:::info
### What are Flaky Tests?

Flaky tests, refer to tests that exhibit inconsistent behavior when executed multiple times under the same conditions. These tests may produce varying results (pass or fail) when run repeatedly, even without any changes to the application or test script.
:::

### Selenium Tests of Automation and HyperExecute

Flaky Test Detection uses the WebDriver command logs to identify the flaky <img src={require('../assets/images/test-intelligence/flake-icon.webp').default} alt="flake icon" width="16" /> tests. The WebDriver commands logs are the steps which are executed by the test script during the test execution. To know more about the WebDriver command logs, you can refer to the [W3C Command Logs](https://www.w3.org/TR/webdriver2/#endpoints).

It uses the following algorithm to identify the flaky tests:

- Tests marked as Flaky <img src={require('../assets/images/test-intelligence/flake-icon.webp').default} alt="flake icon" width="16" />  have shown inconsistent behavior. The inconsistent behaviour is characterized by the transitions in the `status` of the test considered in the [sliding window of tests](/support/docs/test-intelligence-flakiness-test-detection/#how-to-use-the-custom-flaky-test-detection-settings).
- We utilize our in-house algorithm to map transitioning tests in accordance to the configurations specified by the user. A `test transition` occurs when the status of a test switches from  Passed->Failed or Failed->Passed
- For instance, when analyzing a test's status sequence, Passed -> Failed -> Passed, signifies that the test's status has undergone two transitions within the most recent three executions and the transitions are spotted accordingly.
- Similarly the algorithm identifies the tests where the commands are showing a different behavior than the previous runs. This analysis examines individual test commands and their statuses, offering a granular view of potential sources of flakiness <img src={require('../assets/images/test-intelligence/flake-icon.webp').default} alt="flake icon" width="16" /> at the command level.


  

:::caution Supported Frameworks
Currently, this feature only support `Selenium` based tests for Web Automation and HyperExecute subscribers.

## Exploring different metrics in Flaky Test Detection

In Flaky Test Detection , some metrics play a crucial role in assessing and categorizing test results. Understanding these metrics is essential for identifying and addressing inconsistencies in automated testing.

1. **Flake Rate**
The Flake Rate is a metric that measures the current flake rate within a specific group of tests. In Flaky Test Detection, tests are grouped based on criteria such as test name, browser, operating system (OS), and resolution. This metric assesses the inconsistency across test runs of the same name by quantifying transitions in test status and provides valuable insights into the collective performance of similar tests under varying conditions.

  **Use Case:** Picture a group of tests. The Flake Rate serves as a measure of the degree of consistency or inconsistency observed in the test status, when these tests are executed repeatedly

1. **Flaky Commands**
The No. of Flaky Commands is a metric used to define the order of flakiness <img src={require('../assets/images/test-intelligence/flake-icon.webp').default} alt="flake icon" width="16" /> of an individual test. It signifies the inconsistency of different commands within the same test.

  **Use Case:** Consider a single test that performs a series of commands. The number of flaky commands will let the user know how many commands have inconsistencies in a single test.

3. **Command Flakiness Percentage**
The Command Flakiness Percentage is a metric employed to define the order of flakiness <img src={require('../assets/images/test-intelligence/flake-icon.webp').default} alt="flake icon" width="16" /> of a specific command within a test. It assesses the inconsistency of the same command executed across different test runs within the same group. This level of granularity helps pinpoint potential sources of flakiness <img src={require('../assets/images/test-intelligence/flake-icon.webp').default} alt="flake icon" width="16" /> at the command level.

  **Use Case:** Within a test, individual commands may produce inconsistent results. The Command Flakiness Percentage identifies the fluctuations in each command, aiding in precise root cause analysis.

:::info
Understanding these metrics allows you to:

- Assess the overall consistency of tests within a group.
- Identify specific tests that exhibit inconsistent behavior.
- Drill down to individual commands to pinpoint sources of flakiness <img src={require('../assets/images/test-intelligence/flake-icon.webp').default} alt="flake icon" width="16" />.
- Prioritize improvements and optimizations based on the level of inconsistency revealed by these metrics.

## Customizing Flaky Test Detection <NewTag value='New' color='#000' bgColor='#ffec02' />
### How to use the Custom Flaky Test Detection settings?

Go to the `Test Intelligence` section in `Org Product Preferences` under `Organization Settings` to locate the following settings:

<img loading="lazy" src={require('../assets/images/test-intelligence/custom_ftd2.webp').default} alt="cmd" width="768" height="373" className="doc_img"/>

- **Grouping Mechanism:**
  The grouping mechanism provides you with the ability to determine the criteria for categorizing tests for flakiness <img src={require('../assets/images/test-intelligence/flake-icon.webp').default} alt="flake icon" width="16" />. By default, tests are grouped based on your testing environment specified in the [capabilities](https://www.lambdatest.com/capabilities-generator/), which include parameters such as test name, browser, operating system (OS), and resolution.

  :::note Test Capabilities
    For instance, if you execute a test suite for the login functionality of your application, the test group name could be designated as `Login` in the capabilities of your test.
    ```
    const capability = {
      "browserName": "Chrome",
      "browserVersion": "118.0",
      "LT:Options": {
        "username": "<USERNAME>",
        "accessKey": "<ACCESS_KEY>",
        "platformName": "Windows 10",
        "project": "Flaky Test Detection",
        "name": "Login",
        "w3c": true,
        "plugin": "node_js-node_js"
      }
    }
    ```
  :::

  The primary criterion for grouping is the `test name`, and you also have the flexibility to tailor this grouping according to your specific needs. This customization can be achieved by deselecting one or more of the environment variables, allowing you to precisely define how tests are categorized.

- **Sliding Window of previous test runs:**
The sliding window represents the number of preceding tests taken into account when assessing the potential flakiness <img src={require('../assets/images/test-intelligence/flake-icon.webp').default} alt="flake icon" width="16" /> of the current test. By default, this threshold is configured to include the last 10 tests in the analysis. Altering this threshold allows you to customize the historical data considered for evaluation. Increasing the threshold may provide a more extensive historical context, potentially identifying subtle patterns or fluctuations in test results. Conversely, reducing the threshold can lead to a more focused assessment, ideal for quicker insights when dealing with a large number of tests. Finding the right balance in selecting the sliding window threshold is key to optimizing your test reliability analysis.

- **Flake Rate Threshold:**
You can set the flake rate threshold to define when a test is marked as flaky. The default threshold is 20%. Tests crossing this threshold will be marked flaky <img src={require('../assets/images/test-intelligence/flake-icon.webp').default} alt="flake icon" width="16" />. By adjusting the threshold, you can fine-tune the sensitivity of flakiness detection. Lowering it may result in more tests being flagged as flaky, helping you catch minor inconsistencies, while increasing it can provide a higher level of tolerance, focusing on more significant deviations in test behavior. Selecting an appropriate threshold empowers you to tailor your flakiness detection precisely to your testing needs.


:::info

## Identifying flakiness in test status
Flakiness is characterized by the inconsistency observed in prior executions of the same test, which implies that a test can be deemed flaky even in the absence of flaky individual commands within the test. Since flakiness is predicated on the variability of the test's status across executions, a test will retain its flaky classification until its Flake Rate falls below the predefined threshold. The decline in the Flake Rate corresponds to achieving consistency in test executions.
