# LambdaTest SSO & Okta Integration

* * *

LambdaTest allows you to integrate an external user directory with your LambdaTest Organization through an IDP so your team could leverage the Single Sign-on setup. With Okta, you can integrate your LambdaTest organization in two ways i.e. through the Dev Console or the SAML.

After you integrate your Okta instance with your LambdaTest for Single Sign-on, you can benefit from the following features:
* SP-initiated SSO.
* IdP-initiated SSO.
* Group Assignment via Groups on Okta.

To know more, refer to <a href="https://help.okta.com/en/prod/Content/Topics/Reference/glossary.htm">Okta's glossary</a>.

## Prerequisites ##
---
To enable LambdaTest SSO through Okta integration:

* You will need an Enterprise plan with LambdaTest.
* The Admin of your LambdaTest organization needs to raise a request for enabling SSO. They could drop us an email over <a href="mailto:support@lambdatest.com">support@lambdatest.com</a> or could reach out to us via our <span className="doc__lt" onClick={() => window.openLTChatWidget()}>**24/7 in app chat support**</span>.
* You will also need the admin level access of your organization in Okta.
