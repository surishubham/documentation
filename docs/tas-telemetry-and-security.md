# Telemetry and Security
***
## Telemetry
***
We collect telemetry data during the build process to identify errors. In addition we ask you to opt-in to send us regular usage telemetry during the setup process. 
Data collected is strictly anonymous in nature and cannot be used to uniquely identify a user.
What data is collected?

### TAS Cloud
If you are using our cloud version, we collect the stats of which builds were successful, which were unsuccessful and need our help. 

### TAS - Self hosted via Synapse
Synapse is a lightweight proxy and does not capture any data returned by your APIs, databases, or third-party tools.

During the installation process, we collect stats of which installations were successful, which were unsuccessful and need our help. 

This is used to analyze the: 
- Installation Started
- Installation Success
- Installation Errors
- Installation Support

We also collect the stats of which builds were successful, which were unsuccessful and need our help.
