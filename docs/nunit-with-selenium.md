# NUnit with Selenium: Tutorial to run your first test on Lambdatest
***
In this topic, you will learn how to configure and run your C# automation testing scripts on [LambdaTest Selenium Grid](https://www.lambdatest.com/blog/why-selenium-grid-is-ideal-for-automated-browser-testing/) using **C#** framework **NUnit**.

## Objective
***
By the end of this topic, you will be able to:

1. Set up an environment for testing your hosted web pages using **NUnit** framework with **Selenium**.
2. Understand and configure the core capabilities required for your Selenium test suite.
3. Run test cases in parallel using **NUnit** with **Selenium** to reduce build times.
4. Test your locally hosted pages on LambdaTest platform.
5. Explore advanced features of LambdaTest.

>**Note:** All the code samples in this documentation can be found in the [LambdaTest's Repository on GitHub](https://github.com/LambdaTest/CSharp-NUnit-Selenium). You can either download or clone the repository to quickly run your tests.

## Prerequisites For Running NUnit Selenium Tests
***
>**Note:** This tutorial is specifically for Windows users using **Microsoft Visual Studio**.

Before you can start performing **C#** automation testing with **Selenium**, you would need to:

* Download and install **Selenium WebDriver** from the [official website](https://www.selenium.dev/downloads/).
* Make sure you work with latest version of C#.
* **.Net** framework to deliver guidelines while developing a range of application using C#.
* Download [Selenium WebDriver Language Binding](https://www.selenium.dev/downloads/) for C# and extract them to appropriate folder. A [.NET Core SDK](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/download) of 2.1 or greater version.
* You would also need LambdaTest tunnel binary file for testing your locally hosted or privately hosted projects.

### Installing Selenium Dependencies and Tutorial Repo

**Step 1:** Clone the LambdaTestâ€™s [CSharp-NUnit-Selenium repository](https://github.com/LambdaTest/CSharp-NUnit-Selenium) and navigate to the code directory as shown below:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/LambdaTest/CSharp-NUnit-Selenium
cd CSharp-NUnit-Selenium
```

### Setting up Your Authentication
Make sure you have your LambdaTest credentials with you to run test automation scripts with C# on LambdaTest Selenium Grid. You can obtain these credentials from the [LambdaTest Automation Dashboard](https://automation.lambdatest.com/login) or through LambdaTest Profile.

**Step 2:** Set LambdaTest Username and Access Key in environment variables.

 * For Linux/macOS:
 `export LT_USERNAME="YOUR_USERNAME" export LT_ACCESS_KEY="YOUR ACCESS KEY"`
 * For Windows:
 `set LT_USERNAME="YOUR_USERNAME" set LT_ACCESS_KEY="YOUR ACCESS KEY"`

## Run Your First Test
***
### Sample Test Case

**Step 3:** Navigate to `NUnitSeleniumTests.cs` using VSCode. Here is a sample code base for a single C# automated test using NUnit Framework. Copy and replace this code in the NUnitSeleniumTests.cs file in the project you opened in the previous step.
```csharp
using System;
using OpenQA.Selenium;
using OpenQA.Selenium.Remote;
using NUnit.Framework;
using System.Threading;
using System.Collections.Generic;

namespace NUnitSelenium
{

    public class NUnitSeleniumSample1
    {
        public static string LT_USERNAME = Environment.GetEnvironmentVariable("LT_USERNAME") == null ? "YOUR LT_USERNAME" : Environment.GetEnvironmentVariable("LT_USERNAME");
        public static string LT_ACCESS_KEY = Environment.GetEnvironmentVariable("LT_ACCESS_KEY") == null ? "YOUR LT ACCESS KEY" : Environment.GetEnvironmentVariable("LT_ACCESS_KEY");
        public static bool tunnel = Boolean.Parse(Environment.GetEnvironmentVariable("LT_TUNNEL") == null ? "false" : Environment.GetEnvironmentVariable("LT_TUNNEL"));
        public static string build = Environment.GetEnvironmentVariable("LT_BUILD") == null ? "YOUR BUILD NAME" : Environment.GetEnvironmentVariable("LT_BUILD");
        public static string seleniumUri = "https://hub.lambdatest.com:443/wd/hub";


        ThreadLocal<IWebDriver> driver = new ThreadLocal<IWebDriver>();
        private String browser;
        private String version;
        private String os;

        [SetUp]
        public void Init()
        {

            DesiredCapabilities capabilities = new DesiredCapabilities();
            capabilities.SetCapability(CapabilityType.BrowserName, "Chrome");
            capabilities.SetCapability(CapabilityType.Version, "96");
            capabilities.SetCapability(CapabilityType.Platform, "Windows 10");

            //Requires a named tunnel.
            if (tunnel)
            {
                capabilities.SetCapability("tunnel", tunnel);
            }
            if (build != null)
            {
                capabilities.SetCapability("build", build);
            }

            capabilities.SetCapability("user", LT_USERNAME);
            capabilities.SetCapability("accessKey", LT_ACCESS_KEY);

            capabilities.SetCapability("name",
            String.Format("{0}:{1}",
            TestContext.CurrentContext.Test.ClassName,
            TestContext.CurrentContext.Test.MethodName));
            driver.Value = new RemoteWebDriver(new Uri(seleniumUri), capabilities, TimeSpan.FromSeconds(600));
            Console.Out.WriteLine(driver);
        }

        [Test]
        public void Todotest()
        {
            {
                Console.WriteLine("Navigating to todos app.");
                driver.Value.Navigate().GoToUrl("https://lambdatest.github.io/sample-todo-app/");

                driver.Value.FindElement(By.Name("li4")).Click();
                Console.WriteLine("Clicking Checkbox");
                driver.Value.FindElement(By.Name("li5")).Click();


                // If both clicks worked, then te following List should have length 2
                IList<IWebElement> elems = driver.Value.FindElements(By.ClassName("done-true"));
                // so we'll assert that this is correct.
                Assert.AreEqual(2, elems.Count);

                Console.WriteLine("Entering Text");
                driver.Value.FindElement(By.Id("sampletodotext")).SendKeys("Yey, Let's add it to list");
                driver.Value.FindElement(By.Id("addbutton")).Click();


                // lets also assert that the new todo we added is in the list
                string spanText = driver.Value.FindElement(By.XPath("/html/body/div/div/div/ul/li[6]/span")).Text;
                Assert.AreEqual("Yey, Let's add it to list", spanText);

            }
        }

        [TearDown]
        public void Cleanup()
        {
            bool passed = TestContext.CurrentContext.Result.Outcome.Status == NUnit.Framework.Interfaces.TestStatus.Passed;
            try
            {
                // Logs the result to LambdaTest
                ((IJavaScriptExecutor)driver.Value).ExecuteScript("lambda-status=" + (passed ? "passed" : "failed"));
            }
            finally
            {

                // Terminates the remote webdriver session
                driver.Value.Quit();
            }
        }
    }
}
```
### Configuration of Your Test Capabilities

**Step 4:** In the test script, you need to update your test capabilities. In this code, we are passing browser, browser version, and operating system information, along with LambdaTest Selenium grid capabilities via capabilities object. The capabilities object in the above code are defined as:
```csharp
DesiredCapabilities capabilities = new DesiredCapabilities();
            capabilities.SetCapability(CapabilityType.BrowserName, "Chrome");
            capabilities.SetCapability(CapabilityType.Version, "96");
            capabilities.SetCapability(CapabilityType.Platform, "Windows 10");
```
> **Note:** You can generate capabilities for your test requirements with the help of our inbuilt **[Capabilities Generator tool](https://www.lambdatest.com/capabilities-generator/)**.

### Executing the Test

**Step 5:** Build the solution by clicking on **Build > Build Solution**.

**Step 6:** As shown below click on Test Explorer on your MS Visual Studio:

<p align="center">
<img loading="lazy" src={require('../assets/images/uploads/Test-Explorer-Screen.webp').default} alt="cmd" width="768" height="373" className="doc_img"/>
</p>

**Step 7:** Click on **Run** from the Test Explorer to run the sample test as shown below:

<p align="center">
<img loading="lazy" src={require('../assets/images/uploads/Single-Test-Explorer.webp').default} alt="cmd" width="768" height="373" className="doc_img"/>
</p>

### Executing in Linux/macOS:
 * Install NuGet Packages for the project.
```csharp
cd Packages
nuget.exe install ..\NUnitSelenium\packages.config
```
 * Clean and rebuild project.
```csharp
nmake clean build
```
Your results would be displayed on the test console and on the [LambdaTest dashboard](https://automation.lambdatest.com/). LambdaTest Dashboard will help you view all your text logs, screenshots and video recording for your entire Selenium tests.

## Running Your Parallel Tests Using NUnit Testing Framework
***
### Executing the Parallel Tests
 * **Executing parallel tests in Windows:**

 To run parallel tests, you may go to **Test Explorer** on Visual Studio as mentioned above and click on **Run All** tests to execute the tests. 
 
 * **Executing  parallel tests in Linux/MacOS:**
```bash
nmake test OR nmake all
```
Your results would be displayed on the test console and on the [LambdaTest dashboard](https://automation.lambdatest.com/). LambdaTest Dashboard will help you view all your text logs, screenshots and video recording for your entire Selenium tests.

## Testing Locally Hosted Projects Using NUnit Selenium
***
You can test your locally hosted or privately hosted projects with [LambdaTest Selenium grid cloud](https://www.lambdatest.com/selenium-automation) using LambdaTest Tunnel app. All you would have to do is set up an SSH tunnel using LambdaTest Tunnel app and pass toggle `tunnel = True` via desired capabilities. LambdaTest Tunnel establishes a secure SSH protocol based tunnel that allows you in testing your locally hosted or privately hosted pages, even before they are made live.

>Refer our [LambdaTest Tunnel documentation](https://www.lambdatest.com/support/docs/testing-locally-hosted-pages/) for more information.

Hereâ€™s how you can establish LambdaTest Tunnel.

>Download the binary file of:
>* [LambdaTest Tunnel for Windows](https://downloads.lambdatest.com/tunnel/v3/windows/64bit/LT_Windows.zip)
* [LambdaTest Tunnel for Mac](https://downloads.lambdatest.com/tunnel/v3/mac/64bit/LT_Mac.zip)
* [LambdaTest Tunnel for Linux](https://downloads.lambdatest.com/tunnel/v3/linux/64bit/LT_Linux.zip)

Open command prompt and navigate to the binary folder.

Run the following command:
```bash
LT -user {userâ€™s login email} -key {userâ€™s access key}
```
So if your user name is lambdatest@example.com and key is 123456, the command would be:
```bash
LT -user lambdatest@example.com -key 123456
```
Once you are able to connect **LambdaTest Tunnel** successfully, you would just have to pass on tunnel capabilities in the code shown below :

**Tunnel Capability**
```bash
DesiredCapabilities capabilities = new DesiredCapabilities();
            capabilities.SetCapability("tunnel", true);
```
