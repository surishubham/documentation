**Note:** You need to have **Bug Tracker** as a template in your Airtable account for LambdaTest integration with Airtable to work. After all, we're here to help you collect bugs and post them there. If you don't have a **Bug Tracker** template installed in your Airtable account, refer to [Airtable's official support documentation](https://airtable.com/templates/product-design-and-ux/expOzMycWirMsUOTL/bug-and-issue-tracker) for instantly setting up the template.
