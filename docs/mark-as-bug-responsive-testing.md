# Mark As Bug In Responsive Testing
* * *
You can now avoid the hassle of capturing a screenshot, annotating the same before you finally share it with a teammate by logging onto a respective tool for creating a task. LambdaTest does it all for you.
**Mark as Bug** is a feature that would help you highlight any UI observation from your test sessions on LambdaTest. And it let you share the same with your colleagues on their favorite project management/ bug tracking tools such as Jira and Trello, Hive, Paymo, etc. You can choose the assignee who handles your reported task or bug. You can even mention the description to help them understand your point better. You can do all that while testing on LambdaTest, without having to hop on to any other platform or tool.

>**Note:** Mark as Bug feature is not restricted to any particular feature at LambdaTest. In other words, every type of testing that you perform on LambdaTest will have a mark as a bug embedded in it. Below are various types of testing that we offer at LambdaTest.

* **Real Time Testing:** To help you test your web-app with live interaction by running it on VMs hosted by LambdaTest cloud server.

* **Screenshot Testing:** Automated bulk screenshot testing on 25(browsers + OS) combinations in a single test session.

* **Responsive Testing:** Perform cross browser testing across various mobile & desktop devices to ensure your website renders well across different view-ports. Run [responsive testing](https://www.lambdatest.com/responsive-test-online) on 45+ devices in a single test session.

* **Automation Testing:** Perform automated cross browser testing with our on-cloud Selenium Grid. You can execute parallel testing to trim down your test cycles drastically. Our Selenium Grid support is compatible with every test automation framework that supports Selenium.

* **Smart UI Testing:** Automated visual regression testing that performs a pixel-to-pixel comparison between multiple images & highlights any UI deviations such as padding, icon, text, etc., with respect to the baseline images.

**Did You Know?**<br />
LambdaTest offers more than 2000 real browsers and browser versions on every type of testing so you could maximize test coverage of your cross browser testing.

## How Can I Mark As Bug While Responsive Testing?
***

**Note:** Below is a demonstration of marking a bug from Responsive testing.

**Step 1:** Go to Responsive testing from the left navigation menu, provide the testing URL, and hit the **Generate** button to start your responsive test session.

<img loading="lazy" src={require('../assets/images/responsive-testing/mark-as-bug/mark-1.webp').default} alt="Responsive testing online" width="1366" height="768" className="doc_img"/>

**Step 2:** Once you hit the **Generate** button. You will find a loader  on devices mentioned on the right side of the screen, an indication that the screenshot test has begun. A counter will represent the number of devices for which the screenshot has been successfully generated. You can **stop** the test anytime by using the Stop button.

**Step 3:** Once your responsive test session is complete, you can perform a vertical-scroll to find your desired device for ensuring your RWD(Responsive Web Design). After selecting the device, double-click on the camera icon on top for marking a bug.

**Step 4:** As you double-click on any screenshot, an image editor will pop up with various buttons to help you highlight and annotate your UI observation before sharing the screenshot with your colleagues.

 - You can highlight the bug through different shapes like square, rectangular, circular, or you can even underline. Environment details of the test will be presented at the bottom-left of the image editor.

  - You can also scribble the bug using the pencil icon & add text for annotating the screenshot with the text button's help.

<img loading="lazy" src={require('../assets/images/responsive-testing/mark-as-bug/mark-5.webp').default} alt="scribble the bug" width="1365" height="649" className="doc_img"/>

 -  Choose from a variety of colors to make the bug more noticeable.


<img loading="lazy" src={require('../assets/images/responsive-testing/mark-as-bug/mark-6.webp').default} alt="highlighting the bug" width="1340" height="650" className="doc_img"/>

 -  The eraser icon highlighted below will help you to erase any unwanted highlights.


<img loading="lazy" src={require('../assets/images/responsive-testing/mark-as-bug/mark-7.webp').default} alt="Bug Highlight Eraser" width="1351" height="653" className="doc_img"/>


 - If you have got too much to erase, then the last button at the bottom will do the job for you. It will help you undo any unwanted change in the screenshot.

<img loading="lazy" src={require('../assets/images/responsive-testing/mark-as-bug/mark-8.webp').default} alt="Bug Highlight Bulk Eraser" width="1334" height="651" className="doc_img"/>
