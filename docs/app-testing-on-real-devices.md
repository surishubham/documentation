# App Testing On Real Devices
***
Mobile application testing is the process of testing mobile applications for usability, functionality, and consistency flaws across various mobile devices (Android and iOS). With LambdaTest real device cloud, you can test native mobile apps on a wide range of real Android and iOS devices.

This documentation will help you getting started with mobile app testing on real Android and iOS devices.

## Uploading Your Mobile Apps
***
You can upload your native mobile apps either through a browse/finder or a public cloud link. In case you don't have an app, the LambdaTest sample app will help you easily get started with native mobile app testing.

### Uploading Mobile Apps Through Browse (or Finder)
***

1. Sign into your LambdaTest account. From the left panel, navigate to Real Time Testing and you'll be taken to the **App Testing** tab.

<!---<img loading="lazy" src={require('../assets/images/mobile-testing-real-devices/browser-testing.webp').default} alt="Image"  width="1366" height="625" className="doc_img"/>--->


2. Click on the **Upload** icon. You can choose an application by dragging and dropping it or by browsing for and selecting it. The uploading process will take a few seconds depending on the size of the application.
