# RKTracer Integration
***

Developed by RKValidate, RKTracer is a Code coverage tool capable of generating coverage data for different programming languages like C, C++, C#, Java, Kotlin, JavaScript, Python, etc; regardless of what compiler, cross compiler, embedded targets, or servers you use to test your apps.

With LambdaTest and RKTracer, you can generate Code coverage for your web and mobile apps across 3000+ real browsers, devices, and operating system combinations.

## RKTracer With Web Automation On LambdaTest
***

1. Download the LambdaTest [Java-TestNG GitHub repository](https://github.com/LambdaTest/Java-TestNG-Selenium/).

2. To run the single test using TestNG, pass the build command by prefixing it with `"rktracer"`

```
rktracer mvn test -D suite=single.xml
```

<img loading="lazy" src={require('../assets/images/rktracer-integration/1.png').default} alt="rktracer" width="1345" height="627" className="doc_img"/>

3. Pass the below command to get the test results.

```
rkresults
```

<img loading="lazy" src={require('../assets/images/rktracer-integration/2.png').default} alt="rktracer" width="1345" height="627" className="doc_img"/>


## RKTracer With App Automation On LambdaTest
***

1. Build your app with the RKTracer tool embedded.
2. Login to your LambdaTest account and perform the automated testing of your app.
3. Navigate to the [App Automation dashboard](https://appautomation.lambdatest.com/build) on LambdaTest.
4. Download the Device log file from LambdaTest App Automation dashboard.<br/>

<img loading="lazy" src={require('../assets/images/rktracer-integration/3.png').default} alt="rktracer" width="1345" height="627" className="doc_img"/>

5. Place the downloaded Device log file in your app directory.
6. Convert the file from `JSON` to `.txt` with below command `json2rk devicelog.json > rk-coverage.txt`.

<img loading="lazy" src={require('../assets/images/rktracer-integration/4.png').default} alt="rktracer" width="1345" height="627" className="doc_img"/>

7. Pass the below command to get the test results.

```
rkresults
```

<img loading="lazy" src={require('../assets/images/rktracer-integration/5.png').default} alt="rktracer" width="1345" height="627" className="doc_img"/>


## RKTracer With Real Time App Testing On LambdaTest
***

1. Build your app with the RKTracer tool embedded.
2. Login to your LambdaTest account and perform the real-time testing of your app.
3. Download the App logs of the real-time app test and place them in the build code directory.<br/>

<img loading="lazy" src={require('../assets/images/rktracer-integration/6.png').default} alt="rktracer" width="1345" height="627" className="doc_img"/>

4. Open the terminal from that folder and run the command `node har2rk.js <name of device log har file>`. It will convert the harfile into `rkcoverage.txt`.

5. Run the below command to get the results.

```
“rkresults”
```
<img loading="lazy" src={require('../assets/images/rktracer-integration/7.png').default} alt="rktracer" width="1345" height="627" className="doc_img"/>
