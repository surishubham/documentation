# Mark As Bug In Screenshot Testing
***
> You can now avoid the hassle of capturing a screenshot, annotating the same before you finally share it with a teammate by logging onto a respective tool for creating a task. LambdaTest does it all for you. **Mark as Bug** is a feature that would help you highlight any UI observation from your test sessions on LambdaTest. And you can share the same with your colleagues on their favorite project management/ bug tracking tools such as Jira and Trello, Hive, Paymo, etc. You can choose the assignee who handles your reported task, or Bug. You can even mention the description to help them understand your point better. You can do all that while testing on LambdaTest, without having to hop on to any other platform or tool.

**Note:** Mark as Bug feature is not restricted to any particular feature at LambdaTest. In other words, every type of testing that you perform on LambdaTest will have a mark as bug embedded in it. Below are various types of testing that we offer at LambdaTest.

- **Real Time Testing:** To help you test your web-app with live interaction by running it on VMs hosted by LambdaTest cloud server.

- **Screenshot Testing:** Automated bulk [screenshot testing](https://www.lambdatest.com/support/docs/automated-screenshot-testing/) on 25(browsers + OS) combinations in a single test session.

- **Responsive Testing:** Perform cross browser testing across various mobile & desktop devices to ensure your website renders well across different view-ports. Run responsive testing on 46 devices in a single test session.

- **Automation Testing:** Perform automated cross browser testing with our on-cloud Selenium Grid. You can execute parallel testing to trim down your test cycles drastically. Our [Selenium Grid](https://www.lambdatest.com/blog/why-selenium-grid-is-ideal-for-automated-browser-testing/) is compatible with every test automation framework that supports Selenium.

- **Smart UI Testing:** Automated visual regression testing that performs a pixel-to-pixel comparison between multiple images & highlights any UI deviations such as padding, icon, text, etc., concerning the baseline images.

> **Did You Know?**
LambdaTest offers more than 3000+ real browsers and browser versions on every type of testing so you could maximize test coverage of your cross browser testing.

## How Can I Mark As Bug While Screenshot Testing?

**Note:** Below is a demonstration of marking a bug from Screenshot testing.

**Step 1:** Go to Screenshot testing from the left navigation menu, select your desired browser to test from, and hit the **Capture** button.

<img loading="lazy" src={require('../assets/images/mark_as_bug/mark-as-bug-1.webp').default} alt="Image" width="1344" height="653" className="doc_img"/>

**Step 2:** Once you hit the **Capture** button, you will find a message on the top indicating that the screenshot test has begun.

<img loading="lazy" src={require('../assets/images/mark_as_bug/mark-as-bug-2.webp').default} alt="Image" width="1344" height="653" className="doc_img"/>

**Step 3:** Once the screenshot testing is complete, you will have all the screenshots categorized by browsers selected from your input—double-click on any screenshot you may want to validate.

<img loading="lazy" src={require('../assets/images/mark_as_bug/mark-as-bug-screenshot-3.webp').default} alt="Image" width="1344" height="653" className="doc_img"/>

**Step 4:** As you double-click on any screenshot, an image editor will pop up with various buttons to help you highlight and annotate your UI observation before sharing the screenshot with your colleagues.

- You can highlight the bug through different shapes like square, rectangular, circular, or you can even underline. Environment details of the test will be presented at the bottom-left of the image editor.


<img loading="lazy" src={require('../assets/images/mark_as_bug/mark-as-bug-screenshot-4.webp').default} alt="Image" width="1344" height="653" className="doc_img"/>

- You can also scribble the bug using the pencil icon & add text for annotating the screenshot with the text button's help.

<img loading="lazy" src={require('../assets/images/mark_as_bug/mark-as-bug-screenshot-5.webp').default} alt="Image" width="1344" height="653" className="doc_img"/>

- Choose from a variety of colors available to make the bug more noticeable.

<img loading="lazy" src={require('../assets/images/mark_as_bug/mark-as-bug-screenshot-6.webp').default} alt="Image" width="1344" height="653" className="doc_img"/>

- The eraser icon highlighted below will help you to erase any unwanted highlights.

<img loading="lazy" src={require('../assets/images/mark_as_bug/mark-as-bug-screenshot-7.webp').default} alt="Image"  width="1344" height="653" className="doc_img"/>

-  If you have got too much to erase, then the last button at the bottom will do the job for you. It will help you undo any unwanted change in the screenshot.

<img loading="lazy" src={require('../assets/images/mark_as_bug/mark-as-bug-screenshot-8.webp').default} alt="Image"  width="1344" height="653" className="doc_img"/>

**Step 4:** Once you are done annotating the screenshot, you need to click on the **"Mark as Bug"** button at the bottom-right of the image editor.

<img loading="lazy" src={require('../assets/images/mark_as_bug/mark-as-bug-screenshot-9.webp').default} alt="Image"  width="1344" height="653" className="doc_img"/>

We are continually adding more integration to our platform. If you use some other tool, don’t hesitate to share it with us! Just drop a message through <span className="doc__lt" onClick={() => window.openLTChatWidget()}>**chat**</span> & we’ll bring it here on our platform for you.

As you click on the “**Mark as Bug**” button, an integration specific form would open up. Fill in the fields as per your requirement. For instance, if you have installed LambdaTest + Asana integration, you can fill the below-represented fields.

- You can select which workspace the task should go under.

- You can specify which project the task should be placed under.

- You can choose the assignee for that particular task.

- You can also provide a summary to help you organize & easily identify your tasks.

- You also get to post a description in the description field to help relate the cause of the issue or the card.

<img loading="lazy" src={require('../assets/images/mark_as_bug/mark-as-bug-screenshot-10.webp').default} alt="Image"  width="1344" height="653" className="doc_img"/>

All the fields you populate will be directly reflected in your respective project based upon the integration you have configured with your LambdaTest account. In the above case, the changes would reflect on the respective Asana instance.
