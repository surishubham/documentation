# Slack App Integration

* * *

The LambdaTest Slack App allows you to initiate real-time tests and screenshot tests directly from Slack. Your team can collaborate more effectively by easily communicating on bugs, reducing the feedback loop, and troubleshooting web elements in real-time.

By integrating LambdaTest with Slack App,

* Perform Real time testing with access to 3000+ browser and operating systems on the LambdaTest cloud.
* Run Screenshot testing to capture bulk screenshots of websites and web apps from the saved list. 
* Reuse the generated test cards and relaunch the test with the same configuration.

*To perform the Real-time testing and Screenshot testing, you will need to login with your LambdaTest Account. If you don’t have an account on LambdaTest, visit the [LambdaTest register page](https://accounts.lambdatest.com/register).*
