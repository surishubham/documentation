# Prioritize Your Tests

HyperExecute's job prioritization feature empowers you to ensure that your most crucial tests are executed with precision and timeliness. This feature not only enhances the order of execution but also enables effortless searchability within your testing repository.

## `jobLabel`
***

The `jobLabel` YAML key is used to add tags or labels to jobs. In addition to prioritizing your jobs, you can also use the job labels to search for a job using the relevant label or tag that is assigned to it. To learn more about how to use this feature with the HyperExecute YAML, go through [this section](https://www.lambdatest.com/support/docs/deep-dive-into-hyperexecute-yaml/#23-joblabel).

## Prioritize your Jobs using `jobLabel`
***

You can prioritize your jobs by assigning the job labels **low**, **medium** or **high** to your jobs. The jobs with the priority **high** will be executed first, followed by **medium** priority jobs with **low** priority jobs at the end.

```bash
jobLabel: ['high', 'medium', 'low']
```

:::note
- By default, all of your jobs are assigned **medium** priority. 
- The priority keys are not case sensitive. 
- You can use the priority keys along with your regular job labels too. 
:::

As you can see below, we have executed three jobs; one job is designated as **high** priority, while the remaining two hold **lower** priority labels. HyperExecute is configured to adhere to this prioritization framework during execution. As a result, the high-priority job takes precedence and is processed first, followed sequentially by the medium-priority job and subsequently the low-priority job, even though the higher-priority job is executed later. This prioritized execution sequence ensures efficient task management aligned with the specified priority levels.

## Visualizing Priority Levels
As you can see in the diagram below, when you implement prioritization in your jobs, the high-priority jobs step to the forefront, the medium-priority jobs follow suit, and the low-priority tests gracefully bring up the rear.
