# Tunnel Configuration

***

## How to Configure Tunnel with HyperExecute?

> You can use any version of YAML to pass the Tunnel Parameters.

If you want to use a tunnel with HyperExecute, you will have to download the [HyperExecute CLI](/support/docs/hyperexecute-cli-run-tests-on-hyperexecute-grid/) and configure it.

There are 3 ways to use a tunnel in HyperExecute:

### 1. Simple `tunnel` Connection

Set the `tunnel` flag to `true` to enable it. The cli will launch a tunnel as sub process for accessing your applications which are locally hosted or behind a firewall. 

```bash
tunnel: true
```

### 2. Using Existing `tunnel`

Specify the list of already running tunnel names which you want to use for accessing your applications which are locally hosted or behind a firewall.

```bash
tunnelNames: [“lambdatest_tunnel”]
```

### 3. Advanced `tunnel` Configurations

These are the parameters you can use to configure your [tunnel](/support/docs/deep-dive-into-hyperexecute-yaml/#tunnel) settings when running it.

| Options | Type | Description |
|---------|------|-------------|
|`args`| List of strings | The arguments to pass to your tunnel. For a list of arguments checkout our [tunnel flags](/support/docs/lambda-tunnel-modifiers/) |
|`preOnly`| Boolean | Should the tunnel be enabled for only the pre step. Default false. |
|`postOnly`| Boolean | Should the tunnel be enabled for only the post step. Default false. |
|`global`| Boolean | Should the tunnel be enabled for all the steps? Default true. |
|`systemProxy`| Boolean | Should the tunnel be OS system wide? Default false. |
|`checkTunnelOnFailure`| Boolean | Check tunnel on failure adds a check on our system to check the tunnel connection if a test fails and the tunnel is set to true. This option will retry the test 2 times if tunnel connection is flaky. |

```bash
tunnelOpts:
  global: true
```

## Clone a Repository via Tunnel

Cloning a repository using a tunnel can help secure the transfer of data between the repository and your local machine.

Private repositories are hosted on a private network or behind a firewall, and you need to access them from outside the network. By using a tunnel, you can create a secure connection to the private network and clone the repository as if you were within the network.

You can now clone all your **public** and **private** repositories from your Git provider via **tunnel**.

After specifying the details of your repository, you need to set the `useInCodeSetUp` flag to `true` as shown below.

```bash
sourcePayload:
  platform: git
  link: https://--------
  ref: <your_branch_name>
  accessToken: <your_personal_access_token>
  commit: <optional>

# highlight-next-line
tunnelOpts:
# highlight-next-line
  useInCodeSetUp: true
## this flag is mandatory to pass to enable cloning via tunnel
```

## Troubleshooting

If you are unable to access a particular website via the Actions environment even after setting the `tunnel: true` in the YAML file then please execute the following curl command:

```bash
response=$(curl -o /dev/null -s -w "%{http_code}" https://www.lambdatest.com)

## You need to enter your website URL in place of LambdaTest URL
```

Now you need to check the response of the website by passing the command:

```bash
echo $response
```

The ideal expected response in **200**.
