Integrate LambdaTest Jenkins plugin with your Jenkins Freestyle project for:   
*   Configure your LambdaTest credentials for your Jenkins jobs.
*   Set up and tear down the Lambda Tunnel binary file to perform automated cross browser testing even on your locally hosted web apps.
*   Embed all the test results such as video logs, network logs, and screenshots of every step performed through LambdaTest with your Jenkins job results.

> Note: Before you proceed, make sure to integrate [LambdaTest plugin for Jenkins](/docs/jenkins-with-lambdatest/).

**Step 1:** Create a **New Item** in Jenkins and select **Freestyle Project**.

**Step 3:** Under the Built Environments, select LambdaTest and specify your desired capabilities. If you wish to run multiple jobs in parallel then you can **Add Selenium Test Capability**.

>**Note:** It is recommended to check your network connectivity by **pinging LambdaTest**.

**Step 4:** Add a build step to **Execute Shell**. 
<img loading="lazy" src={require('../assets/images/integrating-lambdaTest-with-jenkins-freestyle-project/4.webp').default} alt="Image" width="1024" height="481" className="doc_img"/> 
**Step 5:** Hit the below command to **Execute Shell** and hit **save**.

```
python google-search-lambdatest.py
```

<img loading="lazy" src={require('../assets/images/integrating-lambdaTest-with-jenkins-freestyle-project/5.webp').default} alt="Image" width="1024" height="484" className="doc_img"/> 
**Step 6:** Click on **Apply & Save** to set your configurations and then click on **"Build Now"** to execute your test.

## Test On Locally Hosted Web Applications

* * *

While specifying build environments, check the box to **Use Local Tunnel**. You can then specify a Tunnel name if you like, your LambdaTest Credentials will be automatically fetched.
