# FailFast 

HyperExecute's FailFast feature lets you to optimize your testing regimen by automatically aborting jobs that surpass a specified number of consecutive failures. This intelligent feature ensures that you receive prompt feedback and maintain a well-orchestrated testing process.

> You can use this feature with both the HyperExecute YAML and the HyperExecute CLI.

### `maxNumberOfTests` Flag

The  **maxNumberOfTests**  flag serves as a parameter that determines the number of consecutive tests that need to be failed before the job is aborted automatically.

For instance, if you set the **maxNumberOfTests** flag to 4, then your job will be aborted after four consecutive test failures. However, if three of your jobs fail and the fourth one is passed, then the FailFast feature will reset and look for the next four consecutive jobs that are failing.

This allows you to speed up your test execution process and provide you with faster feedback.

### Implementing FailFast

To leverage the **FailFast** feature, simply incorporate the following command in your HyperExecute YAML file:

```bash
failFast: 
    maxNumberOfTests: 2
```

For a deeper understanding of the HyperExecute YAML and its versatile features, we invite you to explore our dedicated [HyperExecute YAML documentation](/support/docs/deep-dive-into-hyperexecute-yaml/) page. This resource-rich section provides valuable insights to empower your testing endeavors.
