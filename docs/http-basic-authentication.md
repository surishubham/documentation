# HTTP Basic Authentication

* * *

HTTP basic authentication represents a challenge and response mechanism to help the server make a request authentication from a client, passing the User ID and password in the URL as the standard HTTP “Authorization” header. 

For example: `https://username:password@www.example.com/example-page.php`

## Browser Support For HTTP Basic Authentication

* * *
HTTP authentication is incompatible among the majority of the web browser. It is supported by only Google Chrome and Mozilla Firefox.

| BROWSER | SUPPORT FOR BASIC HTTP AUTHENTICATION |
| ------------ | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Google Chrome | Supported |
| Mozilla FireFox | Although supported, Mozilla Firefox may throw a prompt confirmation. Mozilla Firefox performs a check to evaluate whether basic HTTP authentication is mandatory to access the website. In cases, where it isn’t necessary, Firefox will throw a similar warning: “You are about to log in to the site “www.example.com” with the username “username”, but the website does not require authentication. This may be an attempt to trick you.” For more information, refer to the [MDN document](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Authentication). |
