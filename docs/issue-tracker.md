# Issue Tracker
* * *

LambdaTest built-in issue tracker helps you to instantly maintain and handle your bugs at one place. Issue Tracker helps you to manage your cross-test bugs by sharing them across various platforms through e-mails and shared links, exporting bugs in PDF and XLSX formats, printing, deleting, filtering bugs based on different types, and sorting the bugs. Issue Tracker also provides Reproduce at LambdaTest feature to retest your bugs on the same configuration.

## From Where Can I Access The Details Of My Project?

Reproduce on LambdaTest feature allows you to retest your marked bugs on the same test configuration. This feature helps you reduce your efforts of searching for the same test configuration again.

If you or your team wants to retest the same bug again, you can test that particular bug by just clicking on the Reproduce on LambdaTest link.

**Step 1:** Select the bug that you want to retest.

<img loading="lazy" src={require('../assets/images/uploads/issue-tracker-13.webp').default} alt="Image" width="1024" Height="421" className="doc_img"/>

**Step 2:** Your selected bug details would be reflected on the right side. To retest the bug, click on the **'Reproduce on LambdaTest'** link.

<img loading="lazy" src={require('../assets/images/uploads/issue-tracker-14.webp').default} alt="Image" width="1024" Height="417" className="doc_img"/>

**Step 3:** After clicking, you’ll be redirected to the real-time console page on the same test configuration.
