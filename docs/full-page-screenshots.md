# Capturing Full-Page Screenshots Of Your Websites
* * *

[LT Browser](https://www.lambdatest.com/lt-browser/) lets you capture full-page screenshots of your pre-installed mobile devices, desktops, and laptops. Now you can capture your website's long content with the full-page screenshot feature and compare it across multiple devices.

To get started, you need to download the executable file from here.

<div className="download_btn mb-10">
<a href="https://downloads.lambdatest.com/lt-browser/v2/LTBrowser.exe" onClick={() => window.sendAnalytics('Download LT Browser 2.0')}>Download LT Browser For Windows</a>
</div>   

<div className="download_btn mb-10">
<a href="https://downloads.lambdatest.com/lt-browser/v2/LTBrowser.dmg" onClick={() => window.sendAnalytics('Download LT Browser 2.0')}>Download LT Browser For macOS</a>
</div>

<div className="download_btn mb-10">
<a href="https://downloads.lambdatest.com/lt-browser/v2/LTBrowser.deb" onClick={() => window.sendAnalytics('Download LT Browser 2.0')}>Download LT Browser For Linux</a>
</div>

**Step 1:** To [capture full page screenshots](https://www.lambdatest.com/full-page-screen-capture), navigate to the settings button from the top-left and click on the **'Screenshot Full Page'** button.

<img loading="lazy" src={require('../assets/images/full-page-screenshots/image1.webp').default} alt="screenshot" width="1024" height="540" className="doc_img"/>

**Step 2:** Click on the **'Screenshot'** icon.

<img loading="lazy" src={require('../assets/images/full-page-screenshots/image2.webp').default} alt="icon" width="1024" height="541" className="doc_img"/>

Upon clicking on the Screenshot icon, you will receive a prompt message stating **'Capturing screenshot in progress!'**.

<img loading="lazy" src={require('../assets/images/full-page-screenshots/image3.webp').default} alt="capturing" width="1360" height="718" className="doc_img"/>

After the screenshots are taken, you will again receive a prompt message confirming the same.

<img loading="lazy" src={require('../assets/images/full-page-screenshots/image4.webp').default} alt="prompt" width="1360" height="717" className="doc_img"/>

**Step 3:** Then, you will be guided to the page where you can download your full-page screenshots into the LT Browser by pressing the **'Save'** button or you can download your screenshots into your local system by clicking on the **'Arrow'** button.

<img loading="lazy" src={require('../assets/images/full-page-screenshots/image5.webp').default} alt="save" width="1024" height="540" className="doc_img"/>
