# Cypress Testing On Different Screen Resolutions
---

As part of a responsive design process, it is important to ensure that websites or web applications under test run properly on different screen sizes. 

LambdaTest lets you test websites with Cypress across different screen resolutions on over 50+ browser versions on cloud.

Cypress provides website testing on different resolutions using

* Viewports
* Full Screen mode


## Test on Viewports
---

When you define a viewport, Cypress automatically uses the browser's scaling capabilities to customize the size of the web application. Therefore, on defining a large viewport, Cypress will scale down the web application. If you specify a small viewport, Cypress will upscale it.

To set the viewport's width and height globally, you need to define `viewportWidth` and `viewportHeight` in the Cypress configuration file.

**Syntax**

```js
cy.viewport(550, 750) // Set viewport to 550px x 750px
cy.viewport('iphone-6') // Set viewport to 375px x 667px
```
For more details, please check the [official Cypress documentation](https://docs.cypress.io/api/commands/viewport#Syntax).
## Test on Full Screen mode
---

:::tip
The use of full-screen mode in conjunction with viewports can help you achieve good results when performing screen resolution testing for web applications.
:::

To test your web applications in full screen mode, use the following event to change the browser options.

```js
before:browser:launch
```

For **Cypress v9 and below**, use the following script in the `plugin/index.js` file.

```js
module.exports = (on, config) => {
  on('before:browser:launch', (browser = {}, launchOptions) => {
    if (browser.family === 'chromium' && browser.name !== 'electron') {
      launchOptions.args.push('--start-fullscreen')
  
      return launchOptions
    }
  
    if (browser.name === 'electron') {
      launchOptions.preferences.fullscreen = true
  
      return launchOptions
    }
  })
}
```

For **Cypress v10 and above**, you can add the below code in `cypress.config.js` file.

```js
const { defineConfig } = require('cypress')

module.exports = defineConfig({
  
  e2e: {
    setupNodeEvents(on, config) {
      on('before:browser:launch', (browser = {}, launchOptions) => {
        if (browser.family === 'chromium' && browser.name !== 'electron') {
          launchOptions.args.push('--start-fullscreen')
      
          return launchOptions
        }
      
        if (browser.name === 'electron') {
          launchOptions.preferences.fullscreen = true
      
          return launchOptions
        }
      })
    }
  }
})
```
