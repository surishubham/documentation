# HyperExecute Private Cloud Setup with Azure

HyperExecute Private Cloud is now available on the [Azure Marketplace](https://azuremarketplace.microsoft.com/en-us/marketplace/apps/lambdatestinc1584019832435.hyperexeonprem?tab=Overview). 

Follow the steps below to understand how to setup **HyperExecute Private Cloud** via the Azure Marketplace.

## Pre-requisites

1.  **Resource Provider**  
    The following resource providers must be registered to install HyperExecute successfully. If you do not have them registered, follow the steps on this [page](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-resource-manager/management/resource-providers-and-types).
    
    -  Microsoft.Compute
        
    -  Microsoft.OperationsManagement  
          
        
2.  **'EnablePodIdentityPreview` Preview feature**
    
    -   We use AAD Pod Identity feature to enable Kubernetes applications to access cloud resources securely with Azure Active Directory.
        
    -   To use this feature(preview), we need to register the `EnablePodIdentityPreview` feature. If you haven’t registered this feature, follow the steps on this [page](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/aks/use-azure-ad-pod-identity).  
          
        
3.  **CPU Quotas**  
    In order to successfully deploy HyperExecute, we need to increase VM-family vCPU quotas. If you want to increase the quotas of your VM-family vCPU, follow the steps on this [page](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/quotas/per-vm-quota-requests).
    
    - Standard DSv3 Family vCPUs. vCPU core count - 80
        
    - Standard FSv2 Family vCPUs. vCPU core count - 8 * number of parallel licenses.
        
4. **Dedicated Resource Group.**

5. A user with Admin Access who would be running the ARM script as certain resources like resource group, UAMI and related operations would require elevated access for creation.

6. Enablements on Preview features of **Pod Identity**

## IP Ranges
By default the setup creates its own network with IP range `10.26.0.0/16`. if in case the customer needs customised environment than minimum 2 subnets are required to accommodate the resources.

- /24 subnet for test execution machines
- /22 subnet for Kubernetes

> **NOTE:** These requirements vary if the licences are increased more than 100.

**Step 7:** Click on **Create** and you will have successfully set up the HyperExecute Private Cloud.

## Running HyperExecute Private Cloud

Now that you have set up your HyperExecute Private Cloud application, you can access it by visiting `https://dashboard.hyperexecute.cloud`. However, before you do that, you need to ensure that you are connected to the same provisioned network where your HyperExecute application is deployed. 

To do this, you can either perform VNet peering or VNet linking, or run HyperExecute Private Cloud on a JumpHost virtual machine. You can go through the pages below to understand how to do that.

### [VNet Peering and VNet Links](/support/docs/hyperexecute-vnet-peering-for-private-cloud/)
