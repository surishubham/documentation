# MSTest with Selenium: Tutorial to Run Your First Test on LambdaTest
***

In this topic, you will learn how to configure and run your C# automation testing scripts on [LambdaTest Selenium cloud platform](https://www.lambdatest.com/selenium-automation) using **C#** framework **MSTest**.

## Objective
***
By the end of this topic, you will be able to:

1. Set up an environment for testing your hosted web pages using **MSTest** framework with **Selenium**.
2. Understand and configure the core capabilities required for your Selenium test suite.
3. Run test cases in parallel using **MSTest** with **Selenium** to reduce build times.
4. Test your locally hosted pages on LambdaTest platform.
5. Explore advanced features of LambdaTest.

>**Note:** All the code samples in this documentation can be found in the [LambdaTest's Repository on GitHub](https://github.com/LambdaTest/MSTest-Selenium-Sample). You can either download or clone the repository to quickly run your tests.

## Prerequisites For Running MSTest Selenium Scripts
***

Before you can start performing **C#** automation testing with **Selenium**, you would need to:

* Download and Install **Selenium WebDriver** from the [official website](https://www.selenium.dev/downloads/).
* Make sure you work with latest version of C#.
* **.Net** framework to deliver guidelines while developing a range of application using C#.
* Download [Selenium WebDriver Language Binding](https://www.selenium.dev/downloads/) for C# and extract them to appropriate folder.
* A [.NET Core SDK](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/download) of 3.0.0.
* You would also need LambdaTest tunnel binary file for testing your locally hosted or privately hosted projects.

### Installing Selenium Dependencies and Tutorial Repo

**Step 1:** Clone the [LambdaTestâ€™s MSTest-Selenium-Sample repository](https://github.com/LambdaTest/MSTest-Selenium-Sample) and navigate to the code directory as shown below:
```csharp
git clone https://github.com/LambdaTest/MSTest-Selenium-Sample
cd MSTest-Selenium-Sample
```
### Setting up Your Authentication 
Make sure you have your LambdaTest credentials with you to run test automation scripts with C# on LambdaTest Selenium Grid. You can obtain these credentials from the [LambdaTest Automation Dashboard](https://automation.lambdatest.com/login) or through LambdaTest Profile.

**Step 2:** Set LambdaTest Username and Access Key in environment variables.

 * For Linux/macOS:
 `export LT_USERNAME="YOUR_USERNAME" export LT_ACCESS_KEY="YOUR ACCESS KEY"`
 * For Windows:
 `set LT_USERNAME="YOUR_USERNAME" set LT_ACCESS_KEY="YOUR ACCESS KEY"`

## Run Your First Test

### Sample Test Case with MSTest

**Step 3:** Here is a sample code base for a single C# automated test using MSTest Framework. Copy and replace this code in the `LocalMSTest.cs` file.
```csharp
using Microsoft.VisualStudio.TestTools.UnitTesting;
using OpenQA.Selenium;
using OpenQA.Selenium.Remote;
using System;
using System.Threading;

namespace SingleLTSelenium
{
    [TestClass]
    public class SingleLTTests
    {
        IWebDriver driver;
        
        String username = "YOUR LT_USERNAME"; //Enter your username here
        String accesskey = "YOUR LT_ACCESS_KEY"; //Enter your access key here
        String gridURL = "@hub.lambdatest.com/wd/hub";

        DesiredCapabilities capabilities;

        [TestInitialize]
        public void setupInit()
        {
            capabilities = new DesiredCapabilities();

            capabilities.SetCapability("user", username);
            capabilities.SetCapability("accessKey", accesskey);
        }

        [DataTestMethod]
        [DataRow("chrome", "72.0", "Windows 10")]

        [TestMethod]
        public void LT_ToDo_Test(String browser, String version, String os)
        {
            String itemName = "Yey, Let's add it to list";

            capabilities.SetCapability("browserName", browser);
            capabilities.SetCapability("version", version);
            capabilities.SetCapability("platform", os);
            capabilities.SetCapability("build", "LT ToDoApp using MsTest on LambdaTest");
            capabilities.SetCapability("name", "LT ToDoApp using MsTest on LambdaTest");

            driver = new RemoteWebDriver(new Uri("https://" + username + ":" + accesskey + gridURL), capabilities, TimeSpan.FromSeconds(2000));

            driver.Url = "https://lambdatest.github.io/sample-todo-app/";

            Assert.AreEqual("Sample page - lambdatest.com", driver.Title);
            // Click on First Check box
            IWebElement firstCheckBox = driver.FindElement(By.Name("li1"));
            firstCheckBox.Click();

            // Click on Second Check box
            IWebElement secondCheckBox = driver.FindElement(By.Name("li2"));
            secondCheckBox.Click();

            // Enter Item name
            IWebElement textfield = driver.FindElement(By.Id("sampletodotext"));
            textfield.SendKeys(itemName);

            // Click on Add button
            IWebElement addButton = driver.FindElement(By.Id("addbutton"));
            addButton.Click();

            // Verified Added Item name
            IWebElement itemtext = driver.FindElement(By.XPath("/html/body/div/div/div/ul/li[6]/span"));
            String getText = itemtext.Text;
            Assert.IsTrue(itemName.Contains(getText));

            /* Perform wait to check the output */
        System.Threading.Thread.Sleep(2000);

            Console.WriteLine("LT_ToDo_Test Passed");
        }
        
        [TestCleanup]
        public void Cleanup()
        {
            if (driver != null)
                driver.Quit();
        }
    }
}
```
### Configuration of Your Test Capabilities

**Step 4:** In the test script, you need to update your test capabilities. In this code, we are passing browser, browser version, and operating system information, along with LambdaTest Selenium grid capabilities via capabilities object. The capabilities object in the above code are defined as:
```csharp
DesiredCapabilities capabilities = new DesiredCapabilities();
            capabilities.SetCapability(CapabilityType.BrowserName, "Chrome");
            capabilities.SetCapability(CapabilityType.Version, "96");
            capabilities.SetCapability(CapabilityType.Platform, "Windows 10");
```
> **Note:** You can generate capabilities for your test requirements with the help of our inbuilt **[Capabilities Generator tool](https://www.lambdatest.com/capabilities-generator/)**.

### Executing the Test

**Step 5:** Build the solution by clicking in **Build > Build Solution.** 

**Step 6:** As shown below click on **Test Explorer** on your MS Visual Studio:

<p align="center">
<img loading="lazy" src={require('../assets/images/uploads/Test-Explorer-Screen.webp').default} alt="cmd" width="768" height="373" className="doc_img"/>
</p>

**Step 7:** Click on **Run** from the Test Explorer to run the sample test as shown below:

<p align="center">
<img loading="lazy" src={require('../assets/images/uploads/MSTest-Test-Explorer.webp').default} alt="cmd" width="768" height="373" className="doc_img"/>
</p>

**Executing in Linux/macOS:**
```csharp
dotnet test MS-Test-Cross-Browser.csproj
```
Your results would be displayed on the test console and on the LambdaTest dashboard. [LambdaTest Dashboard](https://automation.lambdatest.com/) will help you view all your text logs, screenshots and video recording for your entire Selenium tests.

## Running Your Parallel Tests Using MSTest Testing Framework
***
### Executing the Parallel Tests Using MSTest
To run parallel tests, you may go to **Test Explorer** on Visual Studio as mentioned above and click on **Run All** tests to execute the tests. Your results would be displayed on the test console and on the [LambdaTest dashboard](https://automation.lambdatest.com/). LambdaTest Dashboard will help you view all your text logs, screenshots and video recording for your entire Selenium tests.

## Testing Locally Hosted Projects Using MSTest Selenium
***
You can test your locally hosted or privately hosted projects with [LambdaTest Selenium grid cloud](https://www.lambdatest.com/selenium-automation) using LambdaTest Tunnel app. All you would have to do is set up an SSH tunnel using LambdaTest Tunnel app and pass toggle `tunnel = True` via desired capabilities. LambdaTest Tunnel establishes a secure SSH protocol based tunnel that allows you in testing your locally hosted or privately hosted pages, even before they are made live.

>Refer our [LambdaTest Tunnel documentation](https://www.lambdatest.com/support/docs/testing-locally-hosted-pages/) for more information.

Hereâ€™s how you can establish LambdaTest Tunnel.

>Download the binary file of:
>* [LambdaTest Tunnel for Windows](https://downloads.lambdatest.com/tunnel/v3/windows/64bit/LT_Windows.zip)
* [LambdaTest Tunnel for Mac](https://downloads.lambdatest.com/tunnel/v3/mac/64bit/LT_Mac.zip)
* [LambdaTest Tunnel for Linux](https://downloads.lambdatest.com/tunnel/v3/linux/64bit/LT_Linux.zip)

Open command prompt and navigate to the binary folder.

Run the following command:
```bash
LT -user {userâ€™s login email} -key {userâ€™s access key}
```
So if your user name is lambdatest@example.com and key is 123456, the command would be:
```bash
LT -user lambdatest@example.com -key 123456
```
Once you are able to connect **LambdaTest Tunnel** successfully, you would just have to pass on tunnel capabilities in the code shown below :

**Tunnel Capability**
```bash
DesiredCapabilities capabilities = new DesiredCapabilities();
            capabilities.SetCapability("tunnel", true);
```
