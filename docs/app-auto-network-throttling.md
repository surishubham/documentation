# Network Throttling

***
In Appium testing, assessing your app's performance under diverse network conditions (2G/3G/LTE) and offline scenarios, is crucial. Fluctuating upload and download speeds can significantly impact your app's behavior across different devices.

LambdaTest simplifies testing by enabling simulation of diverse network conditions. Whether starting with defaults or custom profiles, these features replicate real-world scenarios, proving invaluable for Appium tests. The device maintains uninterrupted internet connectivity throughout, ensuring a reliable testing experience for your mobile applications.

## Objectives
----

By the end of this guide, you will learn how to:
- Initialize a test session with predefined network profiles.
- Dynamically change network profiles during test execution using LambdaHooks.
- Define and implement custom network profiles.
- Reset the network profile to default settings.

## Workflow
----
### Initialization

- **Capability:** Initiate a test session with predefined network profiles using the `networkProfile` capability. Example:
     ```python
     caps = {
        "network": True,
        "networkProfile": "2g-gprs-good"  # Set the desired network profile
    }
    ```


:::note
To utilize the **networkProfile** capability, ensure that you include `network: True` in the capabilities 
:::  


### During Test Execution

- **LambdaHook:** Dynamically alter the network profile within the test session using the following LambdaHook:

    ```python
    driver.execute_script("updateNetworkProfile=3g-umts-good")
    ```
- **Offline** mode can be supported during test execution by using using the following LambdaHook (only for **android**):

    ```python
    driver.execute_script("updateNetworkProfile=offline")
    ```

### Supported Network Profiles

| Profile Name             | Download Speed | Upload Speed | Latency |
|--------------------------|-----------------|--------------|---------|
| 2g-gprs-poor             | 20 Kbps         | 6 Kbps       | 1000 ms |
| 2g-gprs-good             | 50 Kbps         | 16 Kbps      | 500 ms  |
| 3g-umts-poor             | 200 Kbps        | 64 Kbps      | 400 ms  |
| 4g-lte-poor              | 1 Mbps          | 500 Kbps     | 200 ms  |
| 3g-umts-good             | 5 Mbps          | 2 Mbps       | 100 ms  |
| 4g-lte-good              | 15 Mbps         | 7 Mbps       | 70 ms   |
| 4g-lte-advanced-good     | 25 Mbps         | 12 Mbps      | 20 ms   |
| default                  | NA             | NA          | NA     |

---
### Custom Profiles

- **LambdaHook:** Define and implement custom network profiles with LambdaHook by specifying the maximum download speed (kbps), maximum upload speed (kbps), and latency (ms) for the custom condition, as illustrated in the example.

    ```python
    driver.execute_script("customNetworkProfile: { \"downloadSpeed\": 500, \"uploadSpeed\" : 250, \"latency\": 100 }" )
    ```

### Default/Reset network configuration

- **LambdaHook:** Employ this webhook to seamlessly restore the device's network profile to its default state. Invocation of this LambdaHook removes any predefined or custom network settings, ensuring the device is reset to its original configuration.

    ```python
    driver.execute_script("updateNetworkProfile=default")
    ```

:::caution
- **Wrong Capability Name or Value:** Providing an incorrect capability value results in a bad request error with a descriptive message.
- **LambdaHook Error:** If you pass any wrong value in LambdaHook,you will receive an error message.
