# Configuring TAS yml
***
In this section we will explain how to make a `.tas.yml` configuration file for your project. This file defines the steps that are required for a test execution job to run on TAS. This step is same for **TAS Cloud** mode and **TAS - Self Hosted** mode. <br/> 
You can begin with the **Basic configurations** first and then go towards the **Advanced configurations** as per the requirements of your project. You can also refer to our **sample configuration file** given at the end of this page.

## Basic configuration parameters
***
### framework
You need to specify which testing `framework` you are using in your repo. Currently, we provide support for `mocha`, `jest` and `jasmine` testing frameworks. <br/>

**Example**
```yml
framework: jest
```

| Required  | Type | Sample Values |
| :----: | ---- | ---- |
| Yes | `string` | `mocha`, `jest`, `jasmine` |
<br/>

### preRun
These are shell commands executed inside the root level of your git repository before running the tests. `preRun` commands are executed using non-login shells by default, so you must explicitly source any dotfiles as part of the command.<br/>

> **NOTE:** You do not need to run any command like `npm run test` etc as we will be running the test cases mentioned by you in the `preRun.command` and `preMerge.pattern`.

**Example**
```yml
preRun:
  command:
    - npm ci
    - npm run lint
  #env:  in case you need to set any env variables
    #NODE_ENV: development
    #AWS_KEY: ${{ secrets.AWS_KEY }} # More details in Managing Secrets section
```

| Sub-Parameters | Required  | Type      | Description   |
| ------------- | :-------: | --------- | :------------- |
| `preRun.command`      | Yes  | `array`   | Array of shell commands executed after running the tests, typically to cleanup the test execution environment. |
| `preRun.env`          | Optional    | `map` | Map of `key/value` pairs to set env variables for the pre run commands. |
<br/>

### postMerge
This section contains the glob patterns for the test cases that you want to execute in the post-merge jobs, a test execution job that will be initiated every time a PR is merged into a branch.<br/>
 
**Example**
```yml
postMerge:
  pattern: 
    # This is a sample glob pattern for all the tests inside the "unit" folder ending with .js extension.
    - test/unit/**/*.js
    # This is a sample glob pattern for all the tests inside the "unit", "node" and "development" folder ending with .js extension.
    - test/{unit,node,development}/**/*.js
  # env: (optional) in case you need to set any env variables
    # NODE_ENV: development
    # AWS_KEY: ${{ secrets.AWS_KEY }} # More details in Managing Secrets section
```

| Sub-Parameters | Required  | Type      | Description   |
| ------------- | :-------: | --------- | :------------- |
| `postMerge.pattern`      | Yes  | `array`   | Array of testfile glob(s) or relative testfile(s) that needs to be executed. |
| `postMerge.env`          | Optional    | `map` | Map of `key/value` pairs to set env variables for the postMerge execution environment. |
<br/>

## Advanced configuration parameters
***

### blocklist
There can be some test cases that you don't want to execute. Here you can add the list of tests, test suites or files that you want to blocklist (ignore) during execution. The input for this parameter is of the format `"<file>##<suite-name>##<test-name>"` <br/>
 
**Example**
```yml
blocklist:
  # blocklist test file.
  - "test/unit/adapters/http.js"
  # blocklist test suite.
  - "test/unit/adapters/http.js##supports http with nodejs"
  # blocklist test-case.
  - "test/unit/adapters/http.js##supports http with nodejs##should support sockets"
```

| Required  | Type |
| :-------: | ---- |
| Optional | `array<string>` | 
<br/>

### preMerge
This section contains the glob patterns for the test cases that you want to execute in the pre-merge jobs, a test execution job that will be initiated every time a PR is raised.<br/>
 
**Example**
```yml
preMerge:
  pattern:
    # This is a sample glob pattern for all the tests inside the "unit" folder ending with .js extension.
    - test/unit/**/*.js
    # This is a sample glob pattern for all the tests inside the "unit", "node" and "development" folder ending with .js extension.
    - test/{unit,node,development}/**/*.js

<br/>

### postRun
These are shell commands executed inside the root level of your git repository after running the tests. postRun commands are executed using non-login shells by default, so you must explicitly source any dotfiles as part of the command.<br/>
 
**Example**
```yml
postRun:
  command:
    - node --version
  #env:  in case you need to set any env variables

### configFile
You might need to add a framework specific configuration file in some cases. The relative path for the configuration file like your custom `mocharc`, `jest.config`, `spec/support/jasmine.json` etc will need to be mentioned here. 

```yml
configFile: test/jest.config.json
```

| Required  | Type |

## Next Steps
***
Once you have prepared the configuration file, place this file correctly inside your repo using the steps mentioned below:
1. In your master branch, **create** a new file as `.tas.yml` at the <b> root level of  your repository </b>. 
2. **Copy** the configuration from the TAS yml configuration page and **paste** them in the `.tas.yml` file you just created.
3. Commit and Push the changes to your repo. 

&ensp; OR 
1. Download the configuration file you have created on the TAS yml configuration page.
2. Rename it to `.tas.yml`. Place it at the root level of your repository.
3. Commit and Push the changes to your master branch.
