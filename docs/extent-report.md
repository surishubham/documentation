# HyperExecute Extent Report

Extent Reports is a popular reporting framework for Java, TestNG, and Selenium tests. It provides a comprehensive set of features for reporting test results, including detailed test case summaries, screenshots and videos of test execution, execution logs, and charts and graphs to analyze test results..

### Pre-requisites

1. Upgrade to extent reporting version 5 in the `pom.xml` file.
2. Update import statements in the codebase from `com.relevantcodes` (version 2) to `com.aventstack` (version 5).

## Implementation Steps

Follow these steps to enable Extent Reports for your HyperExecute job:

### 1. Upgrade Extent Reporting Version

Update the `pom.xml` file to include the latest version of the Extent Reporting library (version 5). Ensure that the necessary dependencies are correctly configured.

```xml
<dependency>
    <groupId>com.aventstack</groupId>
    <artifactId>extentreports</artifactId>
    <version>5.0.0</version>
</dependency>
```

### 2. Modify Import Statements

Update import statements in your codebase to reflect the new package structure in Extent Reporting version 5. Replace `com.relevantcodes` with `com.aventstack`.

```java
// Before
import com.relevantcodes.extentreports.ExtentReports;
import com.relevantcodes.extentreports.ExtentTest;

// After
import com.aventstack.extentreports.ExtentReports;
import com.aventstack.extentreports.ExtentTest;
```

### 3. Generate JSON Reports

Make changes in your codebase to generate individual JSON reports. These reports will serve as the source for the Extent   Reports.

### 4. Update HyperExecute YAML Configuration

In the HyperExecute YAML configuration, add the following section to instruct the HyperExecute systems to generate Extent   Reports:

```yaml
report: true
partialReports:
    type: json
    location: reports/json
    frameworkName: extent
```

## Conclusion

By following these steps, your HyperExecute job will generate Extent Reports, providing a consolidated HTML report derived from individual JSON reports. This enhancement allows customers to access comprehensive and standardized reports conveniently at the conclusion of their HyperExecute jobs.
