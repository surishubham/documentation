# Artifacts

Artifacts are files generated during test execution, including reports and logs. You can refer to these files for obtaining consolidated information about the executed test cases, and can seamlessly interact with artifacts through the HyperExecute UI.

Following the completion of a Job, these artifacts are automatically stored in the **artifacts folder**, distinguishing previous files into **old-artifacts** on subsequent runs while retaining the recent files in artifacts.

## Steps to Generate Artifacts

Follow the below mentioned steps to generate the Artifacts for your desired framework:

**Step 1:** Go to the HyperExecute YAML file

**Step 2:** Add the below mentioned parameters in the YAML file to generate the Artifacts

```bash
uploadArtifacts: 
    - name: #user defined name of the artifact
      path:
        - #path of the generated artifact
    - name: #user defined name of the artifact
      path:
        - #path of the generated artifact
```

```bash
uploadArtifacts:
    - name: Executed-Job-Artifacts
      path:
        - src/test/index.html
    - name: My-Job-Artifacts
      path:
        - src/collect/info.html
```

> **Note:** If you are generating multiple artifacts, then it is recommended to use this parameter, `mergeArtifacts` in your YAML, as it will zip all your Artifacts files while downloading from the dashboard.

```bash
mergeArtifacts: true
uploadArtifacts:
    - name: SrcData
      path:
      - src/test/index.html
```

**Step 3:** Now trigger your job and go to the [HyperExecute](https://hyperexecute.lambdatest.com/hyperexecute/jobs) dashboard.

**Step 4:** Click on any of the artifacts generated.

Here is the sample artifact generated.

:::info
You can replace the Artifacts folder name value with any of the Matrix parameters value.

```bash
matrix:
   os: [win]
   browser: ["chrome-latest-1", "firefox-latest-2"]

uploadArtefacts:
  - name: $browser
    path: 
      - allure-results/
```

As shown in the above code, the artifacts folder generated will be named **chrome-latest-1** and **firefox-latest-2**

## Download the Generated Artifacts

**Step 2:** Click on the **Artifacts** button in the upper right corner.
