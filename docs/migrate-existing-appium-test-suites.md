# Migrate Appium Tests From Local Grid
***
 
LambdaTest offers an online Appium automation grid to perform App automation. Therefore you can easily migrate Appium tests from your local grid to the LambdaTest platform. 

In this documentation, we look at how to leverage LambdaTest cloud for App automation and migrate your test scripts (or test suites) from your local grid. You can use LambdaTest's desired capabilities in your tests, authenticate your test session, and execute tests on the cloud.

## Changes In The Test Script
***

To move from the local grid to the cloud-based Appium grid, you need to make some changes to your automation scripts like authentication, desired capabilities etc.

## Authentication
***

To run tests on LambdaTest, you will need LambdaTest authentication credentials: LambdaTest Username and a LambdaTest Access Key. If you do not have a LambdaTest account, visit the [LambdaTest register page](https://accounts.lambdatest.com/register) and create one.

You can get the LambdaTest Username and LambdaTest Access Key from your LambdaTest Profile.

## Desired Capabilities In Appium
***

Appium's Desired Capabilities are a collection of key-value pairs wrapped inside a JSON object. These key-value pairs request the Appium server for the required test automation session.

Let’s say you want to run an app test in Python on SAMSUNG GALAXY TAB S4 running ANDROID 10. You can define the same in the form of capability as given below.

```python
caps = [

    {
        "deviceName": "Galaxy Tab S4",
        "platformName": "Android",
        "platformVersion": "10",
        "build": "Demo",
    },
]
```

## Running Tests On LambdaTest Appium Grid
***

To begin, change the authentication in your test suite's configuration settings. To run the tests on LambdaTest Appium Grid, you need a valid user name and access key. If you were already performing tests on your local grid, you will need to modify your test script to initialize an Appium driver along with your desired capabilities.

Pass the capabilities to `@hub.lambdatest.com/wd/hub` with your LambdaTest authentication details, and you are done. Here is the sample Python test script.

```python
#samplewikipedia.py

import ssl

try:
    _create_unverified_https_context = ssl._create_unverified_context
except AttributeError:
    # Legacy Python that doesn't verify HTTPS certificates by default
    pass
else:
    # Handle target environment that doesn't support HTTPS verification
    ssl._create_default_https_context = _create_unverified_https_context

    search_results = driver.find_elements_by_class_name(
        "android.widget.TextView")
    assert(len(search_results) > 0)

# Invoke driver.quit() after the test is done to indicate that the test is completed.
    driver.quit()


# The Thread function takes run_session function and each set of capability from the caps array as an argument to run each session in parallel
for cap in caps:
    Thread(target=run_session, args=(cap,)).start()
