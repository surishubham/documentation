## Tutorial To Run Your First Test On LambdaTest

---

In this topic, you will learn how to configure and run your **Rspec** automation testing scripts with **Appium** on **LambdaTest Real Device Cloud platform**.

## Objective

---

By the end of this topic, you will be able to:

1. Run a sample automation script of **Rspec** for application testing with **Appium** on **LambdaTest**.
2. Learn more about Desired Capabilities for Appium testing.
3. Explore advanced features of LambdaTest.

:::tip Sample repo

All the code samples in this documentation can be found on **LambdaTest's Github Repository**. You can either download or clone the repository to quickly run your tests. <a href="https://github.com/LambdaTest/LT-appium-ruby-rspec" className="github__anchor"><img loading="lazy" src={require('../assets/images/icons/github.png').default} alt="Image" className="doc_img"/> View on GitHub</a>

:::

## Pre-requisites

---

Before you can start performing Ruby automation testing with Appium, you would need to:

- You have access to LambdaTest username and accessKey. If you have not registered yet, you can do the same by visiting our [website](https://accounts.lambdatest.com/register). You will be able to access the credentials in the [LambdaTest Profile](https://accounts.lambdatest.com/detail/profile)
- Install **Ruby** on your local system. Follow these instructions to install on different operating systems.


<Tabs className="docs__val">

<TabItem value="rubymac" label="MacOS" default>

For **macOS**, you can run a [Homebrew](https://brew.sh/) command like this:

```bash
brew install ruby
```
</TabItem>

<TabItem value="rubylinux" label="Linux" default>

For **Linux** or **Ubuntu**, you can run a simple apt command like below:

```bash
sudo apt-get install ruby-full
```
</TabItem>

<TabItem value="rubywindows" label="Windows" default>

For **Windows**, you can download from the [official website](https://rubyinstaller.org/downloads/).
</TabItem>
</Tabs>

- Ensure you have Dependency manager bundler installed. If not installed, you can install with the following command:

```bash
gem install bundler
```

## Run your first test

---

### 1. Upload your application
Upload your **_iOS_** application (.ipa file) or **_android_** application (.apk file) to the LambdaTest servers using our **REST API**. You need to provide your **Username** and **AccessKey** in the format `Username:AccessKey` in the **cURL** command for authentication. Make sure to add the path of the **appFile** in the cURL request. Here is an example cURL request to upload your app using our REST API:

 **Using App File from System:**

 <div className="lambdatest__codeblock">
<CodeBlock className="language-bash">
{`curl -u "${ YOUR_LAMBDATEST_USERNAME()}:${ YOUR_LAMBDATEST_ACCESS_KEY()}" -X POST "https://manual-api.lambdatest.com/app/upload/realDevice" -F "appFile=@"/Users/macuser/Downloads/proverbial_android.apk"" -F "name="proverbial_app""
`}
</CodeBlock>
</div>

**Using App URL:**

<div className="lambdatest__codeblock">
<CodeBlock className="language-bash">
{`curl -u "${ YOUR_LAMBDATEST_USERNAME()}:${ YOUR_LAMBDATEST_ACCESS_KEY()}" -X POST "https://manual-api.lambdatest.com/app/upload/realDevice" -F "url=:https://prod-mobile-artefacts.lambdatest.com/assets/docs/proverbial_android.apk" -F "name=Proverbial_App"
`}
</CodeBlock>
</div>

:::tip

- If you do not have any **.apk** or **.ipa** file, you can run your sample tests on LambdaTest by using our sample :link: [Android app](https://prod-mobile-artefacts.lambdatest.com/assets/docs/proverbial_android.apk) or sample :link: [iOS app](https://prod-mobile-artefacts.lambdatest.com/assets/docs/proverbial_ios.ipa).

- Response of above cURL will be a **JSON** object containing the `APP_URL` of the format - <lt://APP123456789123456789> and will be used in the next step.

:::

### 2. Clone the sample project

Clone the LambdaTestâ€™s :link: [LT-appium-ruby-rspec](https://github.com/LambdaTest/LT-appium-ruby-rspec) repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/LambdaTest/LT-appium-ruby-rspec
cd LT-appium-ruby-rspec
```

### 3. Set up your authentication

Make sure you have your LambdaTest credentials with you to run test automation scripts on LambdaTest. To obtain your access credentials, [purchase a plan](https://billing.lambdatest.com/billing/plans) or access the [Automation Dashboard](https://appautomation.lambdatest.com/). Then, set LambdaTest `Username` and `Access Key` in environment variables with following commands.

<Tabs className="docs__val">

<TabItem value="bash" label="Linux / MacOS" default>
  <div className="lambdatest__codeblock">
  <CodeBlock className="language-bash">
  {`export LT_USERNAME=${ YOUR_LAMBDATEST_USERNAME()} \\
export LT_ACCESS_KEY=${ YOUR_LAMBDATEST_ACCESS_KEY()}`}
</CodeBlock>
</div>

</TabItem>

<TabItem value="powershell" label="Windows" default>

  <div className="lambdatest__codeblock">
  <CodeBlock className="language-powershell">
  {`set LT_USERNAME=${ YOUR_LAMBDATEST_USERNAME()} \`
set LT_ACCESS_KEY=${ YOUR_LAMBDATEST_ACCESS_KEY()}`}
</CodeBlock>
</div>

</TabItem>
</Tabs>

### 4. Write your automation script

An automation script for the sample application available above has been provided here. Ensure to update the `APP_URL`, `username` and `accesKey` in the code scripts before running the tests.

<Tabs className="docs__val">
<TabItem value="Single" label="Single Test" default>

```ruby title="single.config.yml"
server: "mobile-hub.lambdatest.com"
user: "LT_USERNAME"         #Add your LambdaTest username here
key: "LT_ACCESS_KEY"  #Add your LambdaTest accessKey here

common_caps:
  "build": "RSpec Selenium Demo"

browser_caps:
  -
    "isRealMobile": "true"
    "platform": "Android"
    "deviceName": "Galaxy A31"
    "platformVersion": "10"
    "app": "APP_URL"        #Add the app url here
```

</TabItem>

<TabItem value="ios" label="Parallel test" default>

```ruby title="parallel.config.yml"
server: "mobile-hub.lambdatest.com"
user: "LT_USERNAME"  #Add your LambdaTest username here
key: "LT_ACCESS_KEY"  #Add your LambdaTest accessKey here

common_caps:
  "build": "RSpec Parallel"
  "visual": false
  "network": false
  "console": false

app_caps:
  -
    "isRealMobile": "true"
    "platform": "Android"
    "deviceName": "Galaxy A31"
    "platformVersion": "10"
    "app": "APP_URL"   #Add the app url here
  -
    "isRealMobile": "true"
    "platform": "Android"
    "deviceName": "Galaxy A32"
    "platformVersion": "11"
    "app": "APP_URL"   #Add the app url here
  -
    "isRealMobile": "true"
    "platform": "iOS"
    "deviceName": "iPhone 13 Pro"
    "platformVersion": "15.0"
    "app": "APP_URL"   #Add the app url here
```

</TabItem>

</Tabs>


### Configure the test capabilities

You can update your custom capabilities in test scripts `lambdatest.rb`. In this sample project, we are passing platform name, platform version, device name and app url (generated earlier) along with other capabilities like build name and test name via capabilities object. The capabilities object in the sample code are defined as:

<Tabs className="docs__val">
<TabItem value="capabilities" label="lambdatest.rb" default>

```ruby
    caps={ 
  
      "LT:Options" => {

   
    "build" => "Ruby RSpec",
    "name" => "Sample Test",
    "platformName" => platform,
    "isRealMobile" => isRealMobile,
    "deviceName" => deviceName,
    "platformVersion" => platformVersion,
    "app" => app,
    "w3c" => true
    },
```

</TabItem>

</Tabs>

:::info Note

- You must add the generated **APP_URL** to the `"app"` capability in the config file.
- You can generate capabilities for your test requirements with the help of our inbuilt **[Capabilities Generator tool](https://www.lambdatest.com/capabilities-generator/)**.For more details, please refer to our guide on [Desired Capabilities in Appium](https://www.lambdatest.com/support/docs/desired-capabilities-in-appium/).

:::

### 5. Execute your test case

1. Run the following command to make sure that all the dependencies required for the test are installed.
```bash
bundle install
```

2. Execute the following command to run single test on LambdaTest platform:
```bash
bundle exec rake single
```

> In order to run parallel tests, run `bundle exec rake parallel`.

:::info
Your test results would be displayed on the test console (or command-line interface if you are using terminal/cmd) and on the :link: [LambdaTest App Automation Dashboard](https://appautomation.lambdatest.com/build).
