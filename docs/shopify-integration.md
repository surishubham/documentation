## How To Take Full Page Screenshot Of Your Shopify Store?
* * *
Once you have integrated your Shopify store with LambdaTest, here's how you can take full page cross-browser screenshots of your store:

- **Step 1:** Visit your product on your Shopify store and select any page that you want to take a screenshot of. Not only your published product pages, but you can also perform a screenshot and cross-browser testing on your drafts as well, using this plugin.

<img loading="lazy" src={require('../assets/images/uploads/shopify-1.webp').default} alt="shopify products" width="1281" height="721" className="doc_img"/>

- **Step 2:** From the **More Actions** menu from the top right corner of your page, select the option for **LambdaTest Screenshot**.

<img loading="lazy" src={require('../assets/images/uploads/shopify.webp').default} alt="shopify actions" width="1281" height="721" className="doc_img"/>

- **Step 3:** As soon as the LambdaTest Screenshot option is chosen, automated screenshots will start generating on the LambdaTest platform with the preset configuration, as shown in the image below:

<img loading="lazy" src={require('../assets/images/uploads/shopify-8.webp').default} alt="lambdatest screenshot testing" width="1281" height="721" className="doc_img"/>

## Customize Your Screenshots Configuration
* * *
By default, the screenshots of your store will be taken in the [Default list](/docs/default-list-of-mobile-and-desktop-browsers-for-automated-screenshot-testing/) of browsers. But, you can always select your favorite combination of Mobile and Desktop browsers for automated screenshot testing via this LambdaTest Shopify plugin.

Let's see you can save your favorite list of browsers. First visit our **[Screenshot testing](https://www.lambdatest.com/support/docs/automated-screenshot-testing/) feature**. You can see a list of browser and OS combinations for Desktop and Mobile, as shown in the image below:

<img loading="lazy" src={require('../assets/images/uploads/shopify-12.webp').default} alt="capture screenshots on multiple browsers" width="1281" height="721" className="doc_img"/>

Then select your favorite list of browsers by either clicking on them, or by selecting them in bulk. You can choose up to 25 different browsers in a single list. For example, first, select some Desktop browsers. In the below image, as you can see, some Firefox browser versions are selected for Windows 10, and some Chrome browser versions are selected for Windows 7.1. As a result, you can see the count of selected browsers mentioned at the top.

<img loading="lazy" src={require('../assets/images/uploads/shopify-13.webp').default} alt="browser screenshot testing" width="1281" height="721" className="doc_img"/>

Now you can also select some Mobile browser combinations, as per your choice. For example, in the image below, we have chosen a few Mobile device and browser combinations. As a result, you can see now all 25/25 browsers have been selected.

<img loading="lazy" src={require('../assets/images/uploads/shopify-14.webp').default} alt="iOS screenshot capture" width="1281" height="721" className="doc_img"/>

Once you have selected your favorite list of Mobile and Desktop browsers, you need to select your list, as per your choice, in which you want to store these. And then click on **Star** icon to mark them as your favorite.

<img loading="lazy" src={require('../assets/images/uploads/shopify-15.webp').default} alt="Favorite Testing Configuration"  className="doc_img"/>

As soon as you do that, your count of saved browsers will be reflected in the list name, as shown in the image below:

<img loading="lazy" src={require('../assets/images/uploads/shopify-16.webp').default} alt="lambdatest favorite" width="1281" height="721" className="doc_img"/>

Now you need to set this list as your chosen configuration for automated screenshots. So, in the Shopify app under My Integrations section, you can see an option to customize the integration **Settings**. When you click on it, you can see a drop-down to select the saved list of favorite browsers for one-click screenshot testing. Initially, the [Default List](/docs/default-list-of-mobile-and-desktop-browsers-for-automated-screenshot-testing/) will be selected. However, you can choose among the Default or the saved Lists (List 1, List 2, or List 3), as per your choice.

<img loading="lazy" src={require('../assets/images/uploads/shopify-7.webp').default} alt="default list screenshot" width="1281" height="721" className="doc_img"/>

> **Note:** If the selected list does not have any saved browsers, then [Default List](/docs/default-list-of-mobile-and-desktop-browsers-for-automated-screenshot-testing/) will be used to generate the screenshots.

>To know about how to save your favorite list of mobile and desktop browsers, refer [Automated Screenshot Testing](/docs/automated-screenshot-testing/).

Now you can repeat the above steps to generate full page automated screenshots and this time they will be according to your favorite list of browsers.

For any generated screenshot, you can also [view](/docs/automated-screenshot-testing/), download, debug , [mark bugs](/docs/mark-as-bug-in-screenshot-testing/), and do much more.

<img loading="lazy" src={require('../assets/images/uploads/shopify-10.webp').default} alt="Lambdatest test settings" width="1281" height="721" className="doc_img"/>
