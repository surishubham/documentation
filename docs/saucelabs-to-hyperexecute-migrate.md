# Migrate from SauceLabs to HyperExecute

## Overview

Sauce Labs and HyperExecute are both cloud-based testing platforms that provide a wide range of browsers and devices for running automated tests. However, HyperExecute provides you with a variety of [features](https://www.lambdatest.com/support/docs/key-features-of-hyperexecute) to help you manage and analyze your test results more easily and efficiently.

By making the switch to HyperExecute, you're not just migrating; you're upgrading your entire testing experience. This document ensures that you have all the information required for a successful migration. Whether you're driven by cost-efficiency, scalability, performance, or advanced features, HyperExecute is the perfect choice for your automated testing needs.

<!-- caters to the needs of product managers, new users, and experienced developers, -->

## Why Migrate to HyperExecute?

There are several benefits to migrating your tests from Sauce Labs to HyperExecute, including:

- **High Speed, High-Quality Testing :** HyperExecute is renowned for its fast and reliable performance. Realize shorter test cycles and quicker feedback, enabling you to deliver high-quality applications at lightning speed.

- **Test Orchestration :** HyperExecute is a cloud-based Test Orchestration platform that enables teams to run tests efficiently across multiple devices and browsers, featuring parallel execution, smart test distribution, automatic test reordering, retry logic, and real-time reporting and analytics.

- **Cost-Efficiency :** HyperExecute doesn't just offer superior [features](https://www.lambdatest.com/support/docs/key-features-of-hyperexecute); it's also cost-effective. By reducing testing time and enhancing productivity, you can optimize your testing budget, allocating resources to other critical areas of your project.

- **Seamless Integration :** HyperExecute provides out-of-the-box support for popular tools such as [Tosca](https://www.lambdatest.com/support/docs/tosca-integration-with-hyperexecute/), [Katalon](https://www.lambdatest.com/support/docs/katalon-integration-with-hyperexecute/), and [Accelq](https://www.lambdatest.com/support/docs/hyperexecute-accelq-integration/). This means you can effortlessly integrate your testing workflow with your preferred tools, streamlining your testing processes.

- **CI/CD Tools :** We offer robust support for [CI/CD](https://www.lambdatest.com/support/docs/hyperexecute-integration-with-ci-cd-tools/) tools, allowing you to automate testing and release processes seamlessly, resulting in faster software delivery.

## Steps to Migrate

To migrate your Test from SauceLabs to HyperExecute, you need to follow the below mentioned steps:

> For demonstration purposes, we'll be using Selenium with the TestNG framework in our examples.

### Step 1: Create your account in HyperExecute

Before starting the migration process, make sure you have created your account in [HyperExecute](https://hyperexecute.lambdatest.com/) and that you have also configured your HyperExecute [UserName and Access Key](https://www.lambdatest.com/support/docs/hyperexecute-how-to-get-my-username-and-access-key/).

### Step 2: Configure CLI and Environment Variables

Since we will be performing the test from our local system, thus in order to initiate a test execution Job, you are required to download HyperExecute [CLI](https://www.lambdatest.com/support/docs/hyperexecute-cli-run-tests-on-hyperexecute-grid/) and set the environment variable.

The *HyperExecute CLI* is used for triggering tests on HyperExecute. It is recommended to download the CLI binary on the host system to perform the tests on HyperExecute. The CLI download site for various platforms is displayed below:

| Platform | HyperExecute CLI download location |
| ---------| --------------------------- |
| Windows | https://downloads.lambdatest.com/hyperexecute/windows/hyperexecute.exe |
| macOS | https://downloads.lambdatest.com/hyperexecute/darwin/hyperexecute |
| Linux | https://downloads.lambdatest.com/hyperexecute/linux/hyperexecute |

Run the below mentioned commands in the terminal to setup the CLI and the environment variables.

For macOS / Linux:

```bash
export LT_USERNAME=YOUR_LT_USERNAME
export LT_ACCESS_KEY=YOUR_LT_ACCESS_KEY
```

For Windows:

```bash
set LT_USERNAME=YOUR_LT_USERNAME
set LT_ACCESS_KEY=YOUR_LT_ACCESS_KEY
```

### Step 3: Configure and Update your Test Scripts

- Add the [HyperExecute YAML](https://www.lambdatest.com/support/docs/deep-dive-into-hyperexecute-yaml/) file in the root folder of your test code repository.

**Sample YAML File**

```bash
---
version: 0.2
globalTimeout: 150
testSuiteTimeout: 150
testSuiteStep: 150

runson: win

autosplit: true
retryOnFailure: true

maxRetries: 1
concurrency: 4
shell: bash
env:
  # PAT: ${{ .secrets.testKey }}
  CACHE_DIR: m2_cache_dir

cacheKey: '{{ checksum "pom.xml" }}'
cacheDirectories:
  - .m2

pre:
  # Skip execution of the tests in the pre step
  - mvn -Dmaven.repo.local=./.m2 dependency:resolve

post:
  - ls target/surefire-reports/

mergeArtifacts: true


uploadArtefacts:
 - name: ExecutionSnapshots
   path:
    - target/surefire-reports/html/**

report: true
partialReports:
  location: target/surefire-reports/html
  type: html
  frameworkName: extent

framework:
  name: maven/testng
  defaultReports: false
  flags:
    - "-Dplatname=mac"

jobLabel: [selenium-testng, mac, autosplit, migration]

```

- Replace the SauceLabs Hooks with [LambdaTest Hooks](https://www.lambdatest.com/support/docs/lambda-hooks/) (if required). 
- Update the SauceLabs Dependencies and Capabilities.

**Sauce Labs** 

```java
MutableCapabilities sauceOptions = new MutableCapabilities();
sauceOptions.setCapability("username", System.getenv("SAUCE_USERNAME"));
sauceOptions.setCapability("accessKey", System.getenv("SAUCE_ACCESS_KEY"));
sauceOptions.setCapability("name", method.getName());
sauceOptions.setCapability("browserVersion", "latest");
```

**HyperExecute**

```java
DesiredCapabilities capabilities = new DesiredCapabilities();
capabilities.setCapability("build", "[HyperExecute - 2] Demonstration of the TestNG Framework");
capabilities.setCapability("name", "[HyperExecute - 2] Demonstration of the TestNG Framework");

capabilities.setCapability("platform", System.getenv("HYPEREXECUTE_PLATFORM"));
capabilities.setCapability("browserName", browser);
capabilities.setCapability("version", version);

capabilities.setCapability("tunnel",false);
capabilities.setCapability("network",true);
capabilities.setCapability("console",true);
capabilities.setCapability("visual",true);
```

#### Update the **Hub URL** and **Authentication** in the Test Scripts

For a Java-based implementation, here are the changes in the script as far as the authentication stage is concerned:

**Sauce Labs** 
``` js
// test.java
public static final String user_name = "SauceLabs_UserName";
public static final String access_key = "SauceLabs_AccessKey";
```

**HyperExecute**
``` js
// test.java
public static final String user_name = "LambdaTest_UserName";
public static final String access_key = "LambdaTest_AccessKey";
```

For a Java-based implementation, here are the changes in the script as far as the Hub URL is concerned:

**Sauce Labs**
``` js
// test.java
public static final String Hub_URL = "https://" + user_name + ":" + access_key + "@ondemand.us-west-1.saucelabs.com:443/wd/hub";
```
**LambdaTest**
``` js
// test.java
public static final String Hub_URL = "https://" + user_name + ":" + access_key + "@hub.lambdatest.com/wd/hub";
```

### Step 4: Execute your Job in HyperExecute

Run the below command in your downloaded CLI to trigger your test scripts in the HyperExecute Platform.

```bash
./hyperexecute --user <your_username> --key <your_access_key> --config <your_yaml_file_name> --download-artifacts --force-clean-artifacts"
```

> In case of MAC, if you get a permission denied warning while executing CLI, simply run `chmod u+x ./hyperexecute` to allow permission. In case you get a security popup, allow it from your **System Preferences** → **Security & Privacy** → **General tab**.

Here is the output in the [HyperExecute Dashboard](https://hyperexecute.lambdatest.com/hyperexecute/jobs).

## Troubleshooting

If you are having trouble migrating your tests from Sauce Labs to HyperExecute, here are some possible solutions:

- #### You may not have updated your Test Scripts.

  To fix this, you will need to replace the Sauce Labs specific code with the equivalent HyperExecute code. You can use the [HyperExecute Capabilities Generator](https://www.lambdatest.com/capabilities-generator/) to help you generate the correct desired capabilities for your tests.

- #### Your Job is executed, but you are getting an error in the HyperExecute Dashboard.

  To fix this, you can check the [documentation](https://www.lambdatest.com/support/docs/hyperexecute-how-to-debug-job/) explaining how you can debug a failed job on your own.
