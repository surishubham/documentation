# Team Management
---

With Organization Settings in LambdaTest, you have the ability to effortlessly invite your team members to your LambdaTest Account. LambdaTest offers a range of roles that can be assigned to users.

At present, LambdaTest supports the following roles:

**Admin:** This role grants full access to all the features and functionalities of LambdaTest, enabling the user to administer the account effectively.

**User:** Users with this role have access to all the subscribed products and are able to execute and stop their own tests. However, certain Organization Settings, such as Team Management, Subscriptions & Invoices, Authentication & SSO, remain inaccessible.

**Guest:** This role provides the ability to view test logs, analytics, and other reports. However, guests do not have the privilege to initiate test runs.

By leveraging the flexibility of Organization Settings, you can seamlessly manage your team members and their respective roles within your LambdaTest Account.
