By leveraging the advanced AI solutions from LambdaTest, teams can enjoy an unmatched experience when it comes to executing tests. This results in enhanced productivity and efficiency throughout the development and testing lifecycle.


## Prerequisites
***

1. A LambdaTest account. Don't have an account, [register for free](https://accounts.lambdatest.com/register).
2. A LocalStack account. Donâ€™t have an account, you can create one [here](https://app.localstack.cloud/sign-in).


## Installing LocalStack CLI
***

The easiest way to begin using LocalStack is by using the `LocalStack` CLI. This handy tool allows you to start LocalStack directly from your command line. However, before you start, ensure your machine has Docker pre-installed, and you can start your Docker engine.

You can refer to the [LocalStack support documentation for installing LocalStack CLI](https://docs.localstack.cloud/getting-started/installation/)  per your system requirements. 


## Generating LocalStack API Key
***

In this section, we will set up out LocalStack account to generate our API keys.

**Step 1:** To get generate your API key, head to **Account**. 

<img loading="lazy" src={require('../assets/images/localstack-integration/local-three.webp').default} alt="add" width="1346" height="647" className="doc_img"/>

**Step 2:** Select the **API Keys** tab.  

<img loading="lazy" src={require('../assets/images/localstack-integration/local-four.webp').default} alt="add" width="1346" height="647" className="doc_img"/>

**Step 3:** Generate and **copy your API Key**. 

## Starting LocalStack CLI

***

To ensure LocalStack functions properly, your API key must be available in the environment variable called `LOCALSTACK_API_KEY`. You have two options for setting this variable: define it beforehand in your environment or set it while starting LocalStack using the LocalStack CLI.

### **For macOS/Linux:**

```bash
export LOCALSTACK_API_KEY=<YOUR_API_KEY>
localstack start -d
```

### **For Windows:**

```bash
$env:LOCALSTACK_API_KEY=<YOUR_API_KEY> localstack start -d
```
## Running LocalStack Test Cases on Your Local Machine
***

To showcase how you can run LocalStack on your local machine and execute your tests, we will showcase a sample solution to resize images uploaded to a local S3 through a serverless application. The solution will feature a simple web user interface that uses local Lambda functions to generate S3 pre-signed URLs allowing the S3 bucket notifications to trigger a Python Lambda that runs image resizing. 

> **Note:** The code for the solution in this post is located in this [repository on GitHub](https://github.com/localstack-samples/sample-serverless-image-resizer-s3-lambda). You can clone this repository and install its local dependencies by executing the following commands in your terminal:

```bash
git clone 
git@github.com:localstack-samples/sample-serverless-image-resizer-s3-lambda.git
cd sample-serverless-image-resizer-s3-lambda
python -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements-dev.txt
```

The above commands will create a Python virtual environment inside the project directory, activate the virtual environment, and install the Python dependencies. To mock the `AWS` commands against LocalStack, you can use `awslocal`, our wrapper around the `AWS CLI`. 

**Step 1:** Install it using `pip`.

```bash
pip install awscli-local
```

**Step 2:** After the installation of `awslocal`, you can create the AWS infrastructure on LocalStack by running the following command:

```bash
bin/deploy.sh
```

The above command will create the **S3 buckets**, put the bucket names into the parameter store, create the `DLQ Topic` for failed Lambda invokes, create the Lambda functions, connect the S3 bucket to the resizer lambda, and create the web application.

> **Note:** You can visit [webapp.s3-website.localhost.localstack.cloud:4566](http://webapp.s3-website.localhost.localstack.cloud:4566/) on your web browser and paste the function URL of the pre sign Lambda function you created earlier.

<img loading="lazy" src={require('../assets/images/localstack-integration/localstack-one.webp').default} alt="add" width="1346" height="647" className="doc_img"/>

**Step 3:** You can fetch the function URL by running the following commands:

```bash
awslocal lambda list-function-url-configs --function-name presign 
awslocal lambda list-function-url-configs --function-name list
```
<img loading="lazy" src={require('../assets/images/localstack-integration/localstack-two.webp').default} alt="remove" width="1347" height="644" className="doc_img"/>

**Step 4:** You can now upload an image file and download the resized file from the `localstack-thumbnails-app-resized` bucket.

**Step 5:** To run the automated integration tests, use `pytest`. Run the following command to execute the tests for your application:

```bash
pytest tests/
```

Now that you have successfully set up an AWS Serverless application on our local machine, executed integration tests, and created local AWS resources, you can look into how to accelerate your testing over HyperExecute to achieve agile & nimble test-driven development.

## Running LocalStack Test Cases On Your HyperExecute
***

One way to run LocalStack test cases on HyperExecute is by leveraging GitHub Actions, the in-built continuous integration, and continuous delivery (CI/CD) platform provided by GitHub. To setup HyperExecute on GitHub Actions, we will create two files:

* A GitHub Action workflow located at .github/workflows/main.yml downloads the HyperExecute CLI binary and sets it up.
* A HyperExecute file located at he.yml declares the workflow of the pipeline execution via a YAML configuration.

**Step 1:** Navigate to the root directory and click on **Add File** button. Name the file `he.yml` and add the following configuration:

```bash
version: "0.1"
runson: linux
autosplit: true
parallelism: 2
concurrency: 2
scenarioCommandStatusOnly: true
runtime:
  language: python
  version: 3.9.16
pre:
  - pip install -r requirements-dev.txt
  - LOCALSTACK_API_KEY=${{ .secrets.LOCALSTACK_API_KEY }} localstack start -d
  - localstack wait -t 60
  - bin/deploy.sh
testDiscovery:
type: raw
mode: dynamic
command: pytest --co -q tests | sed '$d'
testRunnerCommand: pytest $test
sourcePayload:
  platform: git
  link: https://github.com/macnev2013/sample-serverless-image-resizer-s3-lambda
  ref: main
  accessToken: ${{ .secrets.PAT }}
```

<img loading="lazy" src={require('../assets/images/localstack-integration/localstack-three.webp').default} alt="remove" width="1347" height="644" className="doc_img"/>

**Step 2:** Commit the he.yml file on your repository. Ensure that the `LOCALSTACK_API_KEY` secret has been configured in your GitHub repository as a secret. 

**Step 3:** Navigate to the **Settings** page of the repository, and from the sidebar, click **Secrets and Variables**. Click **Actions** and click the **New Repository Secret** button to add the `HE. LOCALSTACK_API_KEY`. This key is added to the HyperExecute Portal.

<img loading="lazy" src={require('../assets/images/localstack-integration/localstack-four.webp').default} alt="remove" width="1347" height="644" className="doc_img"/>

**Step 4:** To create the GitHub Actions pipeline `YAML` file, navigate to the repository where your code is available. In this example, you can assume that we are adding this to the previous code sample that we demonstrated. 

**Step 5:** Under your repository name, click **Actions**. In the left sidebar, click the **New Workflow** button. Add the following `YAML` configuration to the workflow:

```bash
name: HyperExecute
on:
  push:
    branches:
      - main
jobs:
  HE:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v2
      - run: |

wget https://downloads.lambdatest.com/hyperexecute/linux/hyperexecute
          chmod +x hyperexecute
          ./hyperexecute --user nevil.macwan --key ${{ secrets.HE }} 
--config he.yaml        
```

**Step 6:** Save the configuration in your GitHub Actions pipeline. Below is an example of how a test that is run on the GitHub Actions pipeline gets executed:

<img loading="lazy" src={require('../assets/images/localstack-integration/localstack-five.webp').default} alt="remove" width="1347" height="644" className="doc_img"/>

Below is an example of a **HyperExecute** job that was triggered through the above pipeline:

<img loading="lazy" src={require('../assets/images/localstack-integration/localstack-six.webp').default} alt="remove" width="1347" height="644" className="doc_img"/>
