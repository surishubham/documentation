For every enterprise that uses cloud services, access management for those cloud resources is vital. LambdaTest RBAC is an authorization system that allows seamless access management of LambdaTest resources. With LambdaTest role-based access control, you can control who has access to LambdaTest resources, how they can leverage those resources, and what domains they can have access to.

The LambdaTest RBAC will help you in creating the different teams and allot concurrency to those teams. In this way, you can perform the test automation by dividing the concurrency among the teams.
