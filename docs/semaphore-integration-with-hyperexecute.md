# Semaphore Integration with HyperExecute

Semaphore CI/CD is a cloud-based platform that helps engineering teams of all sizes build, test, and deploy their software faster and more reliably. It provides a powerful and flexible way to automate your entire CI/CD pipeline, from code builds to unit tests to production deployments. It is easy to get started with and use, even if you're new to CI/CD. It offers a wide range of features and integrations, so you can customize your pipelines to meet the specific needs of your team and project.

This document will show you how to integrate Semaphore CI/CD with HyperExecute to greatly shorten your test cycles.
