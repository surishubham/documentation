# Zoho Cliq Integration
***

Zoho Cliq is a team communication and collaboration platform designed to enhance productivity and streamline communication within organizations. It offers a range of features to facilitate real-time messaging, audio and video calls, file sharing, and integrations with other business applications.


Integrating LambdaTest with Zoho Cliq, users can create detailed test cards in Zoho Cliq Channels for logged bugs in LambdaTest. This will notify you and your team members every time a new bug is pushed while performing [cross browser testing](https://www.lambdatest.com) of your website from the LambdaTest platform to your Zoho Cliq instance.
