## Generating a HyperExecute YAML 

You can also generate the HyperExecute YAML directly from the HyperExecute Portal. To accomplish this, follow the below mentioned steps:

**Step 1:**  Go to [HyperExecute dashboard](https://hyperexecute.lambdatest.com/hyperexecute), click on the **Help Center**  and select **Generate YAML** from the dropdown.  

<img loading="lazy" src={require('../assets/images/hyperexecute/yaml/1.png').default} alt="Image"  className="doc_img"/>

**Step 2:** Select your preferred test automation framework.

<img loading="lazy" src={require('../assets/images/hyperexecute/yaml/2.png').default} alt="Image" className="doc_img"/>

**Step 3** You will be redirected to the configuring section, where you can configure the HyperExecute YAML parameters. Click on **Generate YAML** button. 

<img loading="lazy" src={require('../assets/images/hyperexecute/yaml/3.png').default} alt="Image" className="doc_img"/>

**Step 4:**  Once done, you can download the YAML file using the small icon on top. Alternatively, you can copy the contents of the file and modify them further according to your needs on your favorite IDE.

> HyperExecute supports multiple languages and testing frameworks. See the comprehensive list & samples [here](/support/docs/hyperexecute-supported-languages-and-frameworks/).


## Sample HyperExecute YAML
A sample HyperExecute YAML file looks like this:

```bash
---
version: 0.1
runson: win
testSuiteTimeout: 65
autosplit: true
retryOnFailure: true
maxRetries: 2
concurrency: 1

env:
  CACHE_DIR: m2_cache_dir
  TARGET_OS: Windows 10

# Dependency caching for Windows
cacheKey: '{{ checksum "pom.xml" }}'
cacheDirectories:
  - ${CACHE_DIR}

# shell: bash

pre:
  # Create the Cache directory
  - mkdir -p m2_cache_dir
  # Download and install packages in the CACHE_DIR.
  # Skip execution of the tests in the pre step
  - mvn -Dmaven.repo.local=${CACHE_DIR} -Dmaven.test.skip=true clean install

testDiscovery:
  type: raw
  mode: dynamic
  command: grep 'public class' src/test/java/hyperexecute/*.java | awk '{print$3}'

testRunnerCommand: mvn `-Dplatname=win `-Dmaven.repo.local=m2_cache_dir `-Dtest=$test test site surefire-report:report
```
