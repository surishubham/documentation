# Password and Access Key Expiration Policy

LambdaTest allows you to set an expiry policy to passwords and access keys for users in your organisation. This means that your password and access keys will expire after a certain number of days, and you will be required to change them or update them, respectively.

> **Note:** Only organization administrators are able to view and manage the Password and Access Key Expiration Policy.

## Why are Password and Access Key Expiry Important?

Password expiration and access key expiration are important security features that can help protect your account from unauthorized access. If your password or access key expires, it will prevent unauthorized users from accessing your account, even if they have your username and old password.

## Setup Password Expiry Policy

By default, password expiration policy is set to **Never**. To change this, follow the below mentioned steps:

**Step 1:** Go to the [LambdaTest](https://accounts.lambdatest.com/dashboard) Dashboard.

**Step 2:** Click on the Settings -> **Organization Settings**, navigate to **Security** tab and click on the **Password Expiry** button

**Step 4:** If you have selected any number of days, and if there are users who have already passed the timeline, they will be immediately logged out. But they will be able to reset their password.

You can also view the password expiration policy for **All the Users** and when their password will expire. You can also add users to the **Excluded Users** list, whose password will never expire (For example, an admin user). You can filter the data based on their specific **Role** as well by clicking on the drop-down menu.
