# Realtime Native Mobile App Testing

***

Mobile app testing is the process of testing a mobile application to ensure that their functionality and usability is not comprised when installed across multiple Android and iOS devices. With LambdaTest, you can test mobile applications manually to ensure they perform seamlessly across all Android emulators and iOS simulators.

## Uploading An App

* * *

You can upload an app via a browser/finder or a public cloud link. If you don't already have an app, the LambdaTest sample app will help you easily get started with native app testing.

### Uploading An App Via Browser

* * *

**Step 1**: Login to your LambdaTest account. Visit **'Real Time Testing**' from the left panel and navigate to the **'App Testing'**.

**Step 2**: Click on **'Upload'**. You can select an application either by drag and drop or browse for and select the application. The uploading process will take few moments depending upon the application'size.

<img loading="lazy" src={require('../assets/images/mobile-app-testing/native-app-testing-1.webp').default} alt="Native Mobile App Testing"  className="doc_img" width="1366" height="629"/>

Your application will be uploaded successfully. Currently, you can upload `.apk` files up to 1GB.

<img loading="lazy" src={require('../assets/images/mobile-app-testing/native-app-testing-2.webp').default} alt="Native Mobile App Testing"  className="doc_img" width="1366" height="629"/>

### Uploading An App Via Public Cloud Link

* * *

**Step 1**: Login to your LambdaTest account. Visit **'Real Time Testing**' from the left panel and you'll be routed to the App testing console page.

**Step 2**: Click on **'URL'**. Enter the App source URL and press Enter.

<img loading="lazy" src={require('../assets/images/mobile-app-testing/native-app-testing-3.webp').default} alt="Native Mobile App Testing"  className="doc_img" width="1366" height="629"/>

Your application will be uploaded successfully.

## Testing Mobile Applications On Android/iOS

* * *

You can test your native mobile apps on Android emulators and iOS simulators. For demonstration, we will be picking up Android.

**Step 1**: Select Real Time Testing from the left panel and navigate to **'App Testing'**.

**Step 2**: Upload your Android app, select the device brand, choose the device and click on **'START'**.

<img loading="lazy" src={require('../assets/images/mobile-app-testing/native-app-testing-4.webp').default} alt="Native Mobile App Testing"  className="doc_img" width="1366" height="629"/> 

An Android emulator will fire up where you can perform native application testing of your mobile apps. 

<img loading="lazy" src={require('../assets/images/mobile-app-testing/Screenshot-239.webp').default} alt="Native Mobile App Testing"  className="doc_img" width="1366" height="629"/>

>
**Note**: Similarly, you can perform mobile app testing on iOS simulators where all the steps and features will remain same.

## Capturing Screenshots And Logging Bugs

* * *

Once the virtual machine is launched, you'll notice the controller buttons on the left panel.

**Step 1**: Click on the **'Mark As Bug'** icon

<img loading="lazy" src={require('../assets/images/mobile-app-testing/Screenshot-240.webp').default} alt="Native Mobile App Testing"  className="doc_img" width="1366" height="629"/>

**Step 2**: Once the screenshot has been captured, you can download the captured screenshot by **'Down Arrow'** icon or can use the built-in image editor tools to mark any bugs or tasks. After that click on **'Mark as Bug'**.

<img loading="lazy" src={require('../assets/images/mobile-app-testing/Screenshot-241.webp').default} alt="Native Mobile App Testing"  className="doc_img" width="1366" height="629"/>

**Step 3**: An integration specific ticket will appear. For example, if you have integration with YouTrack then fill up the details of your bugs in the YouTrack ticket and click on **'Create Issue'**.

<img loading="lazy" src={require('../assets/images/mobile-app-testing/Screenshot-244.webp').default} alt="Native Mobile App Testing"  className="doc_img" width="1366" height="629"/> Your bugs will be marked successfully.

## Recording Video Of A Test Session

* * *

**Step 1**: From the left panel, click on the **'Video'** icon.

<img loading="lazy" src={require('../assets/images/mobile-app-testing/Screenshot-245.webp').default} alt="Native Mobile App Testing"  className="doc_img" width="1366" height="629"/>

**Step 2**: Once you click, the video recording of a current test session will start. To stop the recording, click again on the same video button.

<img loading="lazy" src={require('../assets/images/mobile-app-testing/Screenshot-246.webp').default} alt="Native Mobile App Testing"  className="doc_img" width="1366" height="629"/>

**Step 3**: To view your saved recording of test sessions, click on the **'Gallery'** icon from the left panel and navigate to Video. You can even download these recordings to your local system by clicking on the **'Down Arrow'** button.

<img loading="lazy" src={require('../assets/images/mobile-app-testing/Screenshot-247.webp').default} alt="Native Mobile App Testing"  className="doc_img" width="1366" height="629"/>

## DevTools For Live Debugging

* * *

On clicking the Dev Tools option, you will come across two options i.e., Dev Tools and UI Inspector.  

Using developer tools, you can debug mobile apps on Android and iOS. Currently, you can view your Networks Logs, App Logs, and Device Logs. To view the logs, click on the 'DevTools' icon from the left and all the logs of the current device will be displayed.

<img loading="lazy" src={require('../assets/images/mobile-app-testing/ui-inspector-1.webp').default} alt="Native Mobile App Testing"  className="doc_img" width="1366" height="629"/>

Upon selecting the UI Inspector feature, you can view all the XML details along with the properties table. By clicking on the arrow in the top right corner, UI Inspector allows you to download all the XML details. 

> **Note:** The window of the UI inspector is horizontally expandable if the XML tree is not visible (Only case when the XML tree is not visible properly).

<img loading="lazy" src={require('../assets/images/mobile-app-testing/ui-inspector-2.webp').default} alt="Native Mobile App Testing"  className="doc_img" width="1366" height="629"/>
