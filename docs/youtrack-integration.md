# YouTrack Integration
* * *

YouTrack is a bug tracking and project management tool developed by JetBrains. It allows you to create agile boards, use reports and Gantt charts, dashboards, and time tracking. With YouTrack, you can find issues easily based on autocomplete queries and manipulate them in batches, customize all problem attributes, and create custom workflows.

With LambdaTest and YouTrack integration, you can push bugs directly from LambdaTest to your YouTrack's project. Also, capture screenshots, annotate bugs, and share them with your teammates and colleagues.

## How To Integrate YouTrack With Your LambdaTest Account?

* * *

**Step 1**: Login to your LambdaTest account. To install integrations, you need to have admin or user level access.

**Step 2**: Go to **'Integrations'** from the left menu bar. You will be routed to the integration page where you can find list of third-party applications.

**Step 3**: From the **'Bug Tracker'** category, click on the **'YouTrack'** block.

**Note:** If you already have an existing LambdaTest integration with any project management tool then you will be asked to uninstall the existing LambdaTest integration.


**Step 4**: You will come across two different options to choose from - **Cloud** and **Self Hosted**.

**Step 5:** When you select the **Cloud** option, you need to enter your YouTrack URL as shown below.

*   **What is YouTrack URL?**<br />
YouTrack is the organization's domain name on your YouTrack Projects. It is included in the URL.<br />

*   **What is an API Token?**<br/>
An API token is required to authenticate a user's identity from one server to another by retrieving client resources from the server where the connection is initiated. To ensure its security and data integrity, API tokens are important when an end user connects into an application via a two-step verification process.

**Step 5**: To get the API token, log in to your YouTrack account and navigate to Profile on the top-right.

<img loading="lazy" src={require('../assets/images/uploads/profile.webp').default} alt="Image" width="1341" height="577"  className="doc_img"/>

**Step 6**: Click on the link that says _**'Update personal information and manage logins'**_.

<img loading="lazy" src={require('../assets/images/uploads/hub-account.webp').default} alt="Image" width="1349" height="589"  className="doc_img"/>

**Step 7**: Select the **'Authentication'** tab.

<img loading="lazy" src={require('../assets/images/uploads/auth.webp').default} alt="Image" width="1366" height="551"  className="doc_img"/>

**Step 8**: Click on **'New Token'**.

<img loading="lazy" src={require('../assets/images/uploads/new-token.webp').default} alt="Image" width="1366" height="614"  className="doc_img"/>

**Step 9**: Enter the token name and click on **'Create'**.

<img loading="lazy" src={require('../assets/images/uploads/token-name.webp').default} alt="Image" width="1351" height="622"  className="doc_img"/>

**Step 10**: Your new token will be generated. Click on **'Copy Token'**. <img loading="lazy" src={require('../assets/images/uploads/copy-token.webp').default} alt="Image" width="1351" height="622" className="doc_img"/>

**Step 11**: Enter the Youtrack Domain and copied API token in the provided field and then press **'Install'**.
