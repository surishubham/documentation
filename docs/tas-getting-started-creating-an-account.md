## Selecting Test at Scale Mode
***

​TAS comes in two modes, you can select how you want to use it for your selected organisation. 

1. **TAS Cloud** - You can get started right away on our cloud. No technical setup or installation required. **(Recommended)**
> ❤️ **TAS Cloud** is free for Open source & educational projects. Including hosting and smart features.

2. **TAS - Self Hosted** - You need to setup TAS on your own workstation or cloud. Basic installation & configuration required.


> **NOTE**:  If any team member from your organisation has already signed up on TAS and selected a TAS mode, you will not be asked to select it again. The selected mode would be linked to your organisation and **can not be modified or reverted** later.
