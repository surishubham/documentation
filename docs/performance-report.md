# Performance Report
***

[LT Browser](https://www.lambdatest.com/lt-browser) now integrates with Google Lighthouse that allows you to view the performance report of your web-page instantly. Along with testing the website's responsiveness, you can now test your website performance statistics across 50+ pre-installed device viewports. The Performance Report allows you to view the score of:

* Desktop and Mobile
* Performance, Accessibility, Best Practices, SEO, and Progressive Web App
* Page Load Time and Browser Processing Time

## How To View Performance Report On LT Browser?
***
Make sure you've installed the LT Browser, you will need to login to the LT Browser through your LambdaTest login credentials.

**Step 1:**  Open the LT Browser. Select a device from the device List. For the demo, we are selecting **'Galaxy Note 9'**  and **'13-inch Macbook Air'**.

**Step 2:**  Enter the **'URL'**  in the address bar and press the **'Enter'**  button.

<img loading="lazy" src={require('../assets/images/performance-report/k12-1024x542.webp').default} alt="Image"  className="doc_img" width="1024" height="542"/>

**Step 3:**  Once the website is loaded over the selected device, click on **'Performance Report'**  button on the top-right.

<img loading="lazy" src={require('../assets/images/performance-report/k15-1024x539.webp').default} alt="Image"  className="doc_img" width="1024" height="539"/>

Once you click on the Performance Report button, a new tab of Performance Report would open up. You'll find all the performance statistics of the entered website and selected device. You can view:

#### 1. Desktop Score And Mobile Score
 
Based on the performance of your website over different browsers, the desktop and mobile scores are generated. The score has three fields **Poor**, **Average**, and **Medium**.
