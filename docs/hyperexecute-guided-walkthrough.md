# Guided Walkthrough of HyperExecute

This page gives you a guided walkthrough of all the things on the HyperExecute Dashboard and how you can get the most out of the Platform, once you have successfully [ran you first sample Job](/support/docs/hyperexecute-running-your-first-job/). 
***

## Jobs Page

All the tests on HyperExecute get executed as a Job. All the Jobs can be found on our [Jobs page](https://hyperexecute.lambdatest.com/hyperexecute).

<img loading="lazy" src={require('../assets/images/hyperexecute/getting_started/guided-walkthrough/1.png').default} alt="Image"  className="doc_img"/>

Each Job has a `Status`, a unique `Job Number`, a set of `Labels`, info on number of `Tasks` executed as part of that Job, and a `Summary` section followed by the details of the `Job Duration` and who initiated the Job

On this page you have other things such as filters, help center, docs, [secrets management](/support/docs/hyperexecute-how-to-save-and-manage-secrets/) and much more. You can also filter through all of the jobs on the basis of the date, status, type etc.
