# GitLab Integration
***
>GitLab is a web-based Git-repository manager with the purpose of facilitating entire DevOps lifecycle. It helps in the collaboration of different teams working on a project. Ensuring Development, QA, Security, Operations and Product team to sync simultaneously on the same project. GitLab helps in bringing your product a lot faster in the market by reducing the time taken to complete a release cycle in a very significant manner.

The LambdaTest GitLab Integration allows you to create a card directly in your repository from LambdaTest platform. Push an issue to your respective repository anytime, even in the middle of your test session. The fields populated by you when marking as a bug through LambdaTest are displayed as information on the bug in GitLab repository for that testing instance.

**GitLab Integration with LambdaTest, like all of our other integrations to 3rd party applications, is available for freemium as well as premium plan.**

## How To Integrate GitLab With Your LambdaTest Account?
***
**Step 1:** Login to your LambdaTest account. You would need to have Admin or User level access to see and install integrations.

**Step 2:** Select **‘Integrations’** from the left navigation menu bar. This will guide you to a screen where you will find a list of 3rd party applications, available to integrate with your LambdaTest account.

**Step 3:** Here under the ‘Project Management’ Section, you’ll find GitLab. Click on Gitlab block.

<img loading="lazy" src={require('../assets/images/project-management-tools-gitlab-integration/Gitlab-Integrations-Project-Management.webp').default} alt="project management"  className="doc_img" width="1345" height="625"/>

**Step 4:** Once you click on install, you’ll be redirected to a screen. There would 2 options available for you to choose in order to **authenticate GitLab.**

### 1. Via OAuth
***
1. Select the radio button on **‘Via OAuth’** and hit **‘Next’.**

<img loading="lazy" src={require('../assets/images/project-management-tools-gitlab-integration/authenticate-oauth.webp').default} alt="authenticate"  className="doc_img" width="1365" height="651"/>

2. You will be redirected to GitLab login page where you will be asked to provide your login credentials.

<img loading="lazy" src={require('../assets/images/project-management-tools-gitlab-integration/gitlab-login.webp').default} alt="login"  className="doc_img"  width="1345" height="625"/>

3. If you are new to GitLab and want to sign up then you can do so with your GitHub account as well. Once you click on the **‘GitHub’** button you will be redirected to an authorization page. There you will authorize GitLab APIs to fetch your user owned resources from GitHub APIs.

<img loading="lazy" src={require('../assets/images/project-management-tools-gitlab-integration/gitlab-integration.webp').default} alt="gitlab api"  className="doc_img" width="1365" height="675"/>

4. After you login, you will have to authorize LambdaTest to use your account. Click on the green button that says **‘Authorize’.**

<img loading="lazy" src={require('../assets/images/project-management-tools-gitlab-integration/gitlab-authorize.webp').default} alt="authorize"  className="doc_img" width="1365" height="725"/>

---

* **Why do you need to login?**

The purpose of logging in is to bypass the authentication that is applied when two different applications interact using their respective APIs. GitLab APIs uses OAuth 2.0’s [authorization code grant flow](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6749#section-4.1) for generating access tokens on user’s behalf.

* **What is an Access token?**

Access tokens are strings with authorization key required to access an API. They are issued to the client server and are usually opaque. They are used for requesting access to protected, user-specific resources. Access tokens are vital from a security point of view & can be generated in different formats, depending upon security requirements specified on the resource server.

---

That’s it! Go to Integrations again and you will be able to notice a **green tick** indicating that GitLab is successfully **installed**. You can now experience bug logging in a fly from any of your running test session in Lambdatest to your repository directly by a single click.

**Note:** Make sure you already have a project in your Gitlab account before you integrate to avoid any issues

### 2. Using Personal Access Token
***
1. Select the radio button on **‘Cloud’** and click **‘Install’**. Here you’ll need to enter your Gitlab API token to validate integration with LambdaTest.

<img loading="lazy" src={require('../assets/images/project-management-tools-gitlab-integration/Gitlab-Integrations-Project-Management-APIs.webp').default} alt="project management api" className="doc_img" width="1350" height="622"/>
 
2. Login to your Gitlab account. Go to the profile icon on the top-right corner and click on ‘Settings’.

<img loading="lazy" src={require('../assets/images/project-management-tools-gitlab-integration/gitlab-setting.webp').default} alt="setting"  className="doc_img" width="1366" height="627"/>

3. Click the ‘Access Tokens’ from the menu on the left.

<img loading="lazy" src={require('../assets/images/project-management-tools-gitlab-integration/gitlab-accesstoken.webp').default} alt="access token"  className="doc_img"  width="1366" height="627"/>

4. **“Add a personal access token”** by providing a name for the application. Keep the name that is easy for you to remember as you access token will be derived from it. You can also set an expiry date for that token. Also, select the checkboxes for **‘api’, ‘read_user’ & read_repository** as scopes. These scopes will define the access to authenticate API over Basic OAuth for their respective personal token. After selecting the scopes hit the green button to **“Create personal access token”.**

<img loading="lazy" src={require('../assets/images/project-management-tools-gitlab-integration/personal-accesstoken.webp').default} alt="personal access token"  className="doc_img" width="1365" height="693"/>

---
* **What is a Personal Access Token?**

In scenarios where OAuth is excessively utilized, Personal Access Tokens comes to aid in accessing the API. While generating a token, make sure you provide a description that is easy to remember, as your Personal Access Token will be derived from it. Treat this token just as you would treat your own password! Access tokens are strings with authorization key required to access an API. They are issued to the client server and are usually opaque. They are used for requesting access to protected, user-specific resources. Access tokens are vital from a security point of view & can be generated in different formats, depending upon security requirements specified on the resource server.

---

After you click on **“Create personal access token”,** you will get a prompt message saying **“Your new personal access token has been created”.** You will find it under the highlighted field.

<img loading="lazy" src={require('../assets/images/project-management-tools-gitlab-integration/Gitlab-Integrations-Project-Management-enter.webp').default} alt="create token"  className="doc_img" width="1348" height="627"/>

Your **API token** is now ready. Copy the token & store it safely with you, as you will not be able to find it again. Paste the copied token into LambdaTest GitLab Authentication.

<img loading="lazy" src={require('../assets/images/project-management-tools-gitlab-integration/gitlab-apitoken.webp').default} alt="api token"  className="doc_img" width="1346" height="620"/>

That’s it! Go to Integrations again and you will be able to notice a **green tick** indicating that GitLab is successfully installed. You can now experience bug logging in a fly from any of your running test session in Lambdatest to your repository directly by a single click.

<img loading="lazy" src={require('../assets/images/project-management-tools-gitlab-integration/gitlab-integrationcomplete.webp').default} alt="integration complete"  className="doc_img" width="1348" height="627"/>

## Logging Your First Bug Through GitLab Integration?
