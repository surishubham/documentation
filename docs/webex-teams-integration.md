LambdaTest and Webex Teams can be integrated to create detailed test cards in Webex Team Spaces for logged bugs in LambdaTest. This will notify you and your team members every time a new bug is pushed while performing [cross browser testing](https://www.lambdatest.com) of your website from the LambdaTest platform to your Webex Teams instance.

***

**Step 1:** In your LambdaTest Dashboard, head to **Real-Time Testing > Browser Testing** from the left navigation menu.

**Step 5:** In the Webex ticket, fill the bug details like **Assignee, Issue Type, Priority, Summary,** and **Description** and check the **Send to Webex** option. Then click **Mark As Bug** to log the bugs in Webex Teams.

<img loading="lazy" src={require('../assets/images/webex-teams-integration/webex-nine.webp').default} alt="add" width="1346" height="647" className="doc_img"/>
