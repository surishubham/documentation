# Record and Replay Tests using LT Debug 2.0
---

With LT Debug 2.0, you now have the ability to record user interactions through the Chrome Recorder Panel and replay or retest them as automated tests on a cloud grid on over 3000+ real browsers and operating system combinations. This eliminates the need to download code or manually run tests on your local machine, thus streamlining and optimizing your testing process.
