**Step 2:** Select the test configuration of your choice. You can select from a wide variety of desktop browsers & their various versions to perform a test session. You may also choose from multiple operating system & screen resolutions for evaluating the RWD(Responsive Web Design) of the website when rendered across devices of different screen sizes.
