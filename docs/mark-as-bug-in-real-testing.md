# Mark As Bug In Real Time Testing

* * *
>
Now, you can avoid the hassle of capturing a screenshot, annotating the same before you finally share it with a teammate by logging onto a respective tool for creating a task. LambdaTest does it all for you.   
>**Mark as Bug** is a feature that would help you highlight any UI observation from your test sessions on LambdaTest and share the same with your colleagues on their favourite project management/ bug tracking tools like Jira, Trello, Hive, Paymo, etc. You can choose the assignee who handles your reported task or bug. You can even mention the description to help them understand your point better. You can do all that while testing on LambdaTest, without having to hop on to any other platform or tool.
