# iOS Entitlements
***
We support all ipa files generated from different Certificates & Profiles.

However, to install these apps on our devices, we resign your applications with our Resigning Certificate.

This is true for all Certificates & Profiles except the applications generated using an Enterprise Account.

## Disabling Re-Signing In Manual App Testing
***

:::info Note

- Your application must be an Enterprise Application.

:::

When you upload an application that is generated through an Enterprise Account, you have the option at the beginning of your test to disable re-signing by toggling iOS Entitlements.

Once you toggle the iOS Entitlements option, your application's certificates will be preserved.

## Disabling Re-Signing In App Automation
***

:::info Note

- Your application must be an Enterprise Application.

:::

You can prevent re-signing your application with the "resignApp" capability. Upload your enterprise application & specify the capability as "false" to prevent it from being re-signed.

KEY|VALUE|DESCRIPTION
--|--|--
| resignApp            | TYPE: BOOLEAN <br/> DEFAULT: True <br/> `resignApp = true` | 1. By default, if this capability is not passed, your app will be re-signed.<br/> 2. You can pass "false" as a capability to prevent your apps from being re-signed.<br/> 3. This is only for iOS-specific applications and devices |
