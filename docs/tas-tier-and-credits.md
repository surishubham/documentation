# Tier and Credits Consumption
***

With TAS cloud runners we provide a certain amount of free credit quota every month for running your builds. The credit consumption calculation will be based as per described below. You will be only charged for the time your build is actually using compute.

To check the detailed credit usage, go to **Settings** page and select **Usage Details**.
