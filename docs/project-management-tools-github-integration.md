# GitHub Integration
***

GitHub is one of the most popular community among software developers. It helps you with version control by providing a code hosting platform for all. From open source to business, one can share their codes, discover new ideas and discuss about roadblocks, all in order to deliver a better software. GitHub also serves as a project management tool. It allows a team to collaborate from all around the globe.

The LambdaTest GitHub Integration allows you to create a card directly in your repository from LambdaTest platform. Push an issue to your respective repository anytime, even in the middle of your test session. The fields populated by you when marking as bug through LambdaTest are displayed as information on the bug in GitHub repository for that testing instance.

**GitHub Integration with LambdaTest, like all of our other integrations to 3rd party applications, is available as freemium as well as premium plan.**

## How To Integrate GitHub With Your LambdaTest Account?
***

**Step 1:** Login to your LambdaTest account. You would need to have Admin or User level access to see and install integrations.

**Step 2:** Select **‘Integrations’** from the left navigation menu bar. This will guide you to a screen where you will find a list of 3rd party applications, available to integrate with your LambdaTest account.

**Step 3:** Click on **‘ADD’** under the block that says ‘Github’.

**Step 4:** Step 4: Once you click on install, you’ll be redirected to a screen. There would be three options available for you to choose from in order to authenticate GitHub.

### How To Integrate GitHub With Your LambdaTest Account Via OAuth?
***
**Step 1**: Select the radio button on **‘OAuth’** and click on **‘Install’**.

<img loading="lazy" src={require('../assets/images/project-management-tools-github-integration/Screenshot-71.webp').default} alt="github-integration" width="1338" height="610" className="doc_img"/>

You will be redirected to GitHub login page where you need to provide your login credentials.

<img loading="lazy" src={require('../assets/images/project-management-tools-github-integration/image13.webp').default} alt="github-integration" width="1346" height="622" className="doc_img"/>

**Step 2**:  Enter your GitHub login credentials and click on **‘Sign in’**.

<img loading="lazy" src={require('../assets/images/project-management-tools-github-integration/image8.webp').default} alt="github-integration" width="1339" height="613" className="image8"/>

**Step 3**: You’ll be redirected to the OAuth permission page. Click on **‘Authorize LambdaTest’**.

>
**What is OAuth?**<br />
The purpose of OAuth is to bypass the authentication when two different applications interact using their respective APIs. GitHub APIs use OAuth 2.0’s authorization code grant flow for generating access tokens on the user’s behalf.

<img loading="lazy" src={require('../assets/images/project-management-tools-github-integration/Screenshot-74.webp').default} alt="github-integration" width="1331" height="614" className="image8"/>

That’s it! Go to Integrations again and you will be able to notice a green tick indicating that GitHub is successfully installed. You can now experience bug logging in a fly from any of your running test sessions in LambdaTest to your repository directly with a single click.

### How To Integrate GitHub With Your LambdaTest Account Via Cloud?
***

**Step 1**: Select the radio button on **‘Cloud’**. This will ask you to enter your API token.

>
**What is an API Token?**
Access tokens are strings with an authorization key required to access an API. They are issued to the client-server and are usually opaque. They are used for requesting access to protected, user-specific resources. Access tokens are vital from a security point of view & can be generated in different formats, depending upon security requirements specified on the resource server.

<img loading="lazy" src={require('../assets/images/project-management-tools-github-integration/Screenshot-108.webp').default} alt="github-integration" width="1366" height="574" className="doc_img"/>

**Step 4:** After a screenshot is captured, you can annotate any issue or a task with an **in-built image editor.** Once you are done highlighting the bug, click on the button that says **“Mark as Bug”.**

<img loading="lazy" src={require('../assets/images/project-management-tools-github-integration/Screenshot-109.webp').default} alt="github-integration" width="1366" height="562" className="doc_img"/>

**Step 5**: After clicking on **“Mark as Bug”** button a GitHub specific form would open up. Fill the fields as per your requirement.

 - You can select which repo should the observation be marked under.
 - You can select a relevant label for the same UI observation.
 - You can select the Issue’s title.
 - You also get to post a description to help relate the cause of the issue or the card.

## How To Remove GitHub Integration?
***

You can work with one integration at a time. So if you would want to integrate to some 3rd party application of the similar type, other than the GitHub then you would have to remove your present integration. Here is how you can do it.

**Step 1:** Login to your LambdaTest account.

**Step 2:** Select **‘Integrations’** from the left navigation menu bar. This will guide you to the same screen from where you initiated GitHub installation. You will also find other third party applications, available to integrate with your LambdaTest account.

**Step 3:** To remove the GitHub integration, click on **‘REMOVE’** under the category My Integrations.
