# Teamwork Integration

> Teamwork Projects is a cloud-based project management tool to help you manage various operations involving a project with respect to the respective business functionality. It provides a platform to track a project from start to finish. Teamwork Projects is available on iOS, Android, Google Chrome, and the Web. LambdaTest helps you to push bugs directly in Teamwork by moving them to project in a single click. All the details you provide in LambdaTest like a task list, assignee, title and description would automatically be presented in the project on Teamwork.

LambdaTest integration with Teamwork Projects helps you in filing issues directly to your project in Teamwork from LambdaTest platform. With one-click integration, you can push annotated issues to the project of your choice, assign it to the required teammate, and attach necessary screenshots. You can do all that while in the middle of a test session in LambdaTest platform.

Teamwork Integration with LambdaTest, like all of the integrations to 3rd party applications, is available for freemium as well as premium plan.

## How To Establish Integration With Teamwork From Your LambdaTest Account?

**Step 1:** Login to your LambdaTest account. You would need to have Admin or User level access to see and install integrations.

**Step 2:** Select ‘Integrations’ from the left navigation menu bar. This will guide you to a screen where you will find a list of 3rd party applications, available to integrate with your LambdaTest account.

**Step 3:** Click on ‘ADD’ under the block that says ‘Teamwork’.

**Step 4:** Once you click on install, you will be directed to the below screen. You need to provide your Teamwork Project’s API Token credentials in the highlighted fields to establish integration with LambdaTest.

> What is Teamwork Site Address?
Site Address is the domain name of the organization on your Teamwork Projects. It is presented in the URL. We have highlighted it for you.

<img loading="lazy" src={require('../assets/images/teamwork-integration/image-3.webp').default} alt="teamwork integration project" width="1277" height="820" className="doc_img"/>

> What is an API token?
When two different applications interact with each other, a server-to-server communication is established. API token is needed for authenticating user identity from one server to another, by fetching user-owned resources available on the server from where the communication is initiated. API token has been a necessity for maintaining security and data integrity of any application. They are just as vital to an end user as they are to an application. API tokens are relevant if an end user logs in an application through a 2-step verification process.

**Step 5:** You can find your API token from your Teamwork instance by going to the settings. The settings will be available on top right corner of the page. Click on settings and go to “Edit My Details”.

<img loading="lazy" src={require('../assets/images/teamwork-integration/teamwork-4-1.webp').default} alt="teamwork integration account" width="1346" height="584" className="doc_img"/>

**Step 6:** After you click on “Edit My Details”, navigate to “API & Mobile” tab and click on the button that says “Show your Token”.

<img loading="lazy" src={require('../assets/images/teamwork-integration/teamwork-5-1.webp').default} alt="teamwork integration edit" width="1347" height="487" className="doc_img"/>

**Step 7:** As you click on “Show your Token”, your API token will be displayed along with a button to copy it to clipboard. You will also receive a notification at the bottom to indicate that the string has been “Copied to clipboard”.

<img loading="lazy" src={require('../assets/images/teamwork-integration/teamwork-6-1.webp').default} alt="teamwork integration token" width="1346" height="552" className="doc_img"/>

**Step 8:** Paste the API token into the field provided at LambdaTest & hit the ‘Install’ button. You are all set to experience one-click bug logging to share your issues directly from your LambdaTest account to your project on Teamwork.

## How To Log Your First Bug Through Teamwork Integration?

> Note: If you are using Teamwork for the first time, then make sure to create a project for yourself. It is a pre-requisite in order to push screenshots from your LambdaTest account.

**Step 1:** Go for any of the test from the left navigation menu. For demo, we will be taking “Real Time Test” option.

**Step 2:** Present a URL of the web-app you need to test in the dialog box. After that, select any configuration for browser and operating system of your choice & hit ‘Start‘.

**Step 3:** After the VM is launched and operable. You can perform testing on your web-app for finding bugs. If a bug gets revealed, then you need to click on the Bug icon from the left panel for capturing a screenshot of the same. We have highlighted that controller button in the below image.

<img loading="lazy" src={require('../assets/images/teamwork-integration/monday-10.webp').default} alt="bug icon" width="1348" height="655" className="doc_img"/>

**Step 4:** After a screenshot is captured, you can annotate any issue or a task with an in-built image editor. Once you are done highlighting the bug, click on the button that says “Mark as Bug”.

<img loading="lazy" src={require('../assets/images/teamwork-integration/monday-11.webp').default} alt="mark as bug" width="1365" height="654" className="doc_img"/>

**Step 5:** After clicking on “Mark as Bug” button a Teamwork specific form would open up. Fill the fields as per your requirement.

---

* You can select which project should the ticket go under.
* You can set which Task List should the bug go under.
* You can set the priority of the issue.
* You can mention the Title as well to easily organize your bugs.

## How To Remove Teamwork Integration?

> You can work with one integration at a time. So if you would want to integrate to a similar 3rd party application, then you would have to remove your current integration. Here is how you can do that.

**Step 1:** Login to your LambdaTest account.

**Step 2:** Select ‘Settings’ from the left navigation menu bar & click on ‘Integrations’. This will guide you to a screen where you will find 3rd party applications, available to integrate with your LambdaTest account.

**Step 3:** Click on ‘REMOVE’. You can find the remove button right under the ‘Teamwork’ block which would be highlighted with a green tick.
